<h1>Bringing The Popular Tech Meetups to Portland</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Tech/"><img title="pdx-tech-meetup-logo" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="pdx-tech-meetup-logo" src="/public/post-images/12726-165.png" width="240" align="right" height="133" /></a>I’ve been watching the Portland startup scene for years. However, in the last 12 months, it’s really started to take off, so when I had an opportunity to mentor at the recent <a href="http://portland.startupweekend.org/">Portland Startup Weekend</a>, I was all over it. I got to do and see all kinds of wonderful things at PDXSW, but one of the best was meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/thubten">Thubten Comerford</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Phillipi">Tyler Phillipi</a>. Between the three of us, we’re bringing the very popular Tech Meetup conference format to Portland.</p>  <p>The idea of a Tech Meetup is meant to be focused on pure tech. In fact, at <a href="http://nytm.org/">the largest of the Tech Meetups in New York</a> (33,000 members strong!), they have a rule where it’s actually rude to ask about the business model. The Tech Meetups are tech for tech’s sake. If you’re in a company big or small or if you’re just playing, cool tech always has a place at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Tech/">the Portland Tech Meetup</a>.</p>  <p>The format is simple and if you’re familiar with the way they do things in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bdnewtech/events/154800842/">Boulder</a> or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SeattleTechMeetup/">Seattle</a>, you’re already familiar with it. Starting on January 20th, 2014, every 3rd Monday at 6pm, we’ll open the doors for some networking time, providing free food and drink to grease the skids. At 7pm, we’ll start the tech presentation portion of the evening, which should be at least five tiny talks from tech presenters of all kinds. After the talks, we’ll wrap up around 8pm and then head to the local water hold for the debrief.</p>  <p><strong>If this sounds interesting to you, </strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Tech/"><strong>sign up right now</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>  <p><strong>If you’d like to present, </strong><a href="mailto:csells@sellsbrothers.com?subject=I'd like to present at the Portland Tech Meetup!"><strong>drop me a line</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>  <p><strong>If you’d like to sponsor, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/thubten"><strong>let Thubten know</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>  <p>We’re very excited about bringing this successful event to Portland, so don’t be shy about jumping in; the water is fine…</p>
