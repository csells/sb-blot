<h1>Gen<X> will be open-sourced</h1>
<a href="http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0206&L=genx&F=&S=&P=571">Here</a>. "We have decided that the best thing for our user base would be to open source Gen<X>. Of course, open source means different things to different people, so now we are taking a pause to sort out both the open source terms and where the product will be hosted. Expect a more detailed announcement soon."
