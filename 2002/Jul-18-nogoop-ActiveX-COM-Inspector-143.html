<h1>nogoop ActiveX/COM Inspector</h1>
<a href="http://www.nogoop.com">Here</a>. From Francis Upton: Explore any ActiveX/COM object with the nogoop ActiveX/COM Inspector.
Make Automation programming easier by viewing or modifying properties,
and invoking methods on these ActiveX/COM objects.  The Inspector
includes a graphical control design surface, a complete type library
browser, and can register and unregister type libraries.  It
automatically converts type libraries/controls to .NET assemblies, and
allows you to browse and access .NET objects (it includes the complete
capabilities of the .NET Component Inspector).  Requires the .NET
Framework runtime (CLR).
