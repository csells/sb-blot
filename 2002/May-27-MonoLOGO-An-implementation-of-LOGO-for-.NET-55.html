<h1>MonoLOGO: An implementation of LOGO for .NET</h1>
<p>"<a href="http://monologo.sourceforge.net/">MonoLOGO</a> provides access to all .NET constructs from within LOGO. Its goal to be 99% compliant with Berkeley LOGO (there are a few internal UCBLogo directives that won't make sense to support). Eventually I hope to extend the LOGO syntax to support most if not all of .NET's constructs."</p>
