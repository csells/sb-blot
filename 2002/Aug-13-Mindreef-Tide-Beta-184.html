<h1>Mindreef Tide Beta</h1>
<a href="http://www.mindreef.com/tester_application.php">Here</a>. The Mindreef SOAP diagnostic tool (codename: Tide) is now available for
beta testing!

Mindreef develops a Web services diagnostic system that provides value through the entire software development life cycle of SOAP-based solutions. Our initial product, code-named Tide, collects information about SOAP transactions by monitoring communications between SOAP endpoints. It uses the information to provide visibility and insight into Web services communications through features such as logging, debugging, and reporting.

We are currently accepting beta testers. If you're interested in being part of our program, fill out the Beta Tester Questionnaire.
