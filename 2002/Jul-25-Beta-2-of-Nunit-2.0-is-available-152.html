<h1>Beta-2 of Nunit 2.0 is available</h1>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nunit/">Here</a>. "Some of the highlights of the new release include the following:

"- Attribute based mechanism for specifying test and test fixtures.

"- New Forms Interface that displays Tests and TestSuites in an Explorer like fashion. The interface allows you to run individual tests and/or suites from the forms interface.

"- Automatic construction of suites based on namespaces. Just provide an assembly and the test runner constructs a suite of all TestFixtures in the assembly.

"- Minimal amount of effort to upgrade due to inclusion of a backwards compatibility class called TestCase and the framework also looks for methods that begin with "test" regardless of case as it did in the past.

"- XML output from the console program."
