<h1>Happy Birthday, Mono!</h1>
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/#Jul9th,2002">Here</a>. "In a year, we have achieved plenty: 
-94 contributors with CVS access (84 non-Ximian developers). 
-A complete CLI implementation: 
-A fast and performing x86 JIT engine (inlining, constant propagation). 
-An interpreter for other systems (PPC, Sparc, StrongArm). 
-A self-hosting C# compiler, which can compile its class libraries. 
-37,140 file changes in CVS. 
-92,000 lines of C code. 
-437,000 lines of C# code (compiler, classes, tests) 
-A working core for ASP.NET and ADO.NET. 
-Major subsystems are functional: RegularExpressions, System.XML, XML.Schema, System.Data, System.Web. 
-The Gtk# project, which is maturing rapidly."
