<h1>Microsoft Readying 'Avalon' Framework for Longhorn</h1>
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0%2C3959%2C368868%2C00.asp">Here</a>. "Avalon is the key to the new 'inductive' user interface that will debut in Longhorn, sources say. The new UI will allow users to organize and share information more intuitively, most likely using some kind of 'dock,' a la Microsoft Office XP, sources say."
