<h1>BoxDB for .NET - Beta Testers Needed</h1>
<p>"We are currently conducting an open beta-test.</p>

<p>"Built Software recently released <a href="http://www.builtsoftware.com/products/Box/">the first beta of BoxDB for .NET</a>, a library
designed to simplify database application development. BoxDB is an
abstraction layer that sits between your application and a SQL database. The
purpose is twofold: First, BoxDB eliminates the type of repetitive SQL
programming that you might otherwise cut & paste throughout your app.
Second, BoxDB creates a simpler interface for persisting application data to the database."</p>
