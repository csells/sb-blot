<h1>TAPI Explorer</h1>

	<p align="left">I built the TAPI Explorer (tExplorer) to allow me to 
	understand the various capabilities of the telephony devices installed on my 
	system when I was developing TAPI applications and writing my TAPI book. It 
	grew into a utility for showing all line, address and phone capabilities as 
	well as other TAPI settings, e.g. country codes, telephony locations, 
	service providers, etc. If you're running into TAPI errors that you don't 
	understand, TAPI Explorer will help you work through them.</p>

	<p align="left">This version has been run and tested on Windows 98, Windows 
	ME, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 and Windows XP and supports TAPI versions 
	1.4 through 3.1.</p>
