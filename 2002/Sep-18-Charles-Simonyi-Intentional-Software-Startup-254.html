<h1>Charles Simonyi Intentional Software Startup</h1>
<a href="http://intentsoft.com">Here</a>. "Intentional Software Corporation (ISC) is a software engineering company dedicated to assisting software developers in capturing the tremendous latent value that is usually lost in the design and development process. Another name for this latent value is the intent behind the software, so we call this approach Intentional Software."

I've been following Charles work for years, starting with Hungarian Notation (a really good idea at the time, believe me : ) and culminating in his more recent Intentional Programming efforts. I'm very interested in what kinds of tools he's going to be bringing to the world.
