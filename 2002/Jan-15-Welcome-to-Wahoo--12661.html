<h1>Welcome to Wahoo!</h1>
<p><a href="/public/wahoo2/Wahoo.application">
<img border="0" src="/public/wahoo/wahoo.JPG" align="right" hspace="10" width="281" height="590"></a>This page is dedicated to the game of Wahoo! 
-- a .NET application meant to be 
invoked from a .NET client across the internet. </p>
<p>If you'd like the ClickOnce version (for .NET 2.0),
<a href="/public/wahoo2/Wahoo.application">click here</a> and (after clicking a few 
more times), an application that looks like the picture on the right will 
appear.</p>
<p>To invoke the No-Touch Version version (for .NET 1.x),
<a href="/public/wahoo/wahoo.exe">click here</a> and wait a little while. In a few seconds, 
an application that looks like the picture on the right will appear. <i>You 
should note that No-Touch Deployed applications deployed across the Internet are 
disabled by default when .NET 2.0 is installed on the client machine.</i></p>
<p>If you find that Wahoo! doesn't have permission to run on your .NET 1.x computer, you 
can <a href="/public/wahoo/WahooPermissionsSetup.msi">grant Wahoo! Internet permissions using 
this MSI setup file</a> (Keith Brown helped me fix my SP1 permissions problem!). Even the new permissions are pretty strict, e.g. they do not 
even allow writing to the file system. If you'd like to increase the permissions 
allows for Wahoo! so that it can cache high scores to the file system, you can 
do so via the Trust Assembly Wizard available in Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control 
Panel-&gt;Administration Tools-&gt;Microsoft .NET Framework Wizards.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Keith Brown has asked me to remind all of you that 
even though Wahoo! is managed and executes in the .NET security sandbox, the 
code in the MSI to grant permissions for the .NET 1.0x version is running with FullTrust permissions, meaning that it could do 
bad things, where &quot;bad things&quot; is defined as: trash the registry, delete files, 
send email from your account, spread viruses, reformat disks, change arbitrary 
spreadsheet values or formulae, remove single columns from database tables, 
invert the buttons on your mouse, reset your MineSweeper high scores, send lists 
of installed software to Microsoft, and generally misbehave (thanks Tim Ewald 
for the exhaustive list : ). Of course, this applies to any MSI file, setup 
program or any other code that you download onto your machine and run outside of 
the .NET or Win32 security sandboxes. Keith would like everyone to promise to 
stop installing new code of any kind on their machines and let software migrate 
there instead, either via No-Touch Deployment/mobile code-style install-on-demand or via 
administrator-approved means. Keith believes that installing code on your 
machine can only cause trouble and I agree -- unless there is code on your 
machine, nothing bad can happen. Nothing good can happen, either, but &quot;Hey, 
let's be careful out there!&quot;</b></font></p>

<a href="/public/writing/wfbook">The full source code to the .NET 2.0 version is 
available here</a>. 
<a href="/public/wahoo/Wahoo.zip">The full source code to the .NET 1.x version (including the MSI file) is available here</a>. The
<a href="/public/wahoo/html/index.htm">original HTML version</a> is available, as well.</p>
<p>Wahoo! was awarded 
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/windowsforms/WindowsFormsCodingHero2_12_02.aspx">the Windows Forms Coding Heroes Award</a> on 2/12/02 
by the Windows Forms team on GotDotNet. I'd like to thank the academy... : )</p>
