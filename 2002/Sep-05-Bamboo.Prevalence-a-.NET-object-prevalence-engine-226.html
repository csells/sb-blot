<h1>Bamboo.Prevalence: a .NET object prevalence engine</h1>
<a href="http://bbooprevalence.sourceforge.net/">Here</a>. Bamboo.Prevalence is a "prevalence engine" for .NET. If you don't know what that means (I didn't), you can check out [1], which gives a good intro and then provides a FAQ for the skeptical. In a nutshell:

"For many systems it is already feasible to keep all business objects in RAM. ... To avoid losing data, every night your system server saves a snapshot of all business objects to a file using plain object serialization."

I admit to still being skeptical after reading the FAQ, but it's mostly a "this feels wrong, I'll think of a reason later" kind of a skepticism. : )
