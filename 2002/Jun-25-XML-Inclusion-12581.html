<h1>XML & Inclusion</h1>
<p><i><b>guest editorial by Don Box</b>, <span class="created">Tue, Jun 25, 2002</span></i></p>
        <p>Chris, I just read your &quot;Object vs. XML&quot; post on the spout and I'd be 
        pleased if you would allow me to respond with my own personal spoutlet. 
        Here goes:</p>
        <p>For much of the 1990's, I spent a lot of time writing COM code in 
        C++. The combination of C++'s static type system + COM's dynamic type 
        system was a very powerful combination that I am proud to have been 
        involved with, even though my contributions to COM were from afar as a 
        non-Microsoftie.</p>
        <p>In March of 1998, I had the pleasure of working on the initial SOAP 
        protocol with Microsoft and Dave. That experience was a turning point 
        for me, as it forced me to acknowledge type systems that were not part 
        of the classic OO family that I had come to know as the &quot;one true way.&quot;</p>
        <p>Unlike COM or Java, XML tends to attract developers of every stripe, 
        each of which has a wildly different sense of esthetics with respect to 
        language design, data vs. processing model, structural vs. nominal 
        typing, functional vs. declarative vs. imperative styles, etc.</p>
        <p>Because XML's <i>raison d'etre</i> is interop, XML needs to be 
        neutral with respect to these choices, otherwise, the barrier to entry 
        becomes too excessive for some communities to participate. The current 
        pushback against XML Schemas is a great example of this effect.</p>
        <p>XML Schema imposes a type system over XML Infosets that is very 
        similar to the OO type systems you are familiar with. This makes XML 
        Schemas well-suited for importing directly into Java or C# programs. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the XML Schema type system has features that don't 
        make sense if your world doesn't revolve around named user-defined types 
        (e.g., several script languages, SQL, etc.). For that reason, some 
        members of the XML community has been lobbying for something with a 
        looser type model than XML Schemas. Had the XML Schema working group 
        made it clearer how to do this sort of thing with XML Schemas, I believe 
        the time for adoption would be that much shorter.</p>
        <p>Getting back to your original post, I find your characterization of 
        my colleagues and I as &quot;so steeped in the new world that they forget 
        where they came from&quot; a bit misleading. </p>
        <p>As an XML guy, I try not to focus too much on where <i>I</i> came 
        from. Rather, I try to bend over backwards to be respectful of where <i>
        other</i> people came from.</p>
        <p>I don't want the guy writing ML code in Dayton, Ohio to shove his 
        world view down my throat.</p>
        <p>I'm trying hard to reciprocate by keeping my OO/C++/COM sensibilities 
        in perspective.</p>
        <p>XML is about inclusion. </p>
        <p>It's the ultimate Rorschach test. </p>
        <p>We all make it into what we need it to be.</p>
        <p>That's the &quot;secret sauce&quot; that makes XML what it is.</p>
