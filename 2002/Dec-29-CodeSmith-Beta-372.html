<h1>CodeSmith Beta</h1>
<a href="http://www.ericjsmith.net/ejsmith/codesmith.htm">Here</a>. "CodeSmith allows you to create templates that will generate code for any ASCII based language. The code generated can be customized by the use of properties. A property can be any .NET object that has a designer (most built in .NET types have designers already) and can be as simple as a boolean property that allows you to conditionally add or remove code from the result, to an object such as the included TableSchema object which provides everything you could possibly want to know about a table in a database. Having access to this information allows you to generate things such as stored procedures, business objects, presentation layer code, or anything else you can think of based on a table schema."

This looks like a promising code-gen tool, and I've seen more than my share...
