<h1>Alintex Script Host brings scripting to .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.alintex.com">Here</a>. From Alintex: Alintex Script Host lets you run scripts written in three Microsoft .NET languages - VB, C# and JScript.

One can take full advantage of the power of the .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) to produce lightweight, yet powerful applications and utilities. Amongst other features, it allows you to mix and match all three supported .NET languages in the same script, yet optionally produce a single XML based Portable Script file for easy distribution.

Alintex Script Host is FREE for both personal and commercial use.
