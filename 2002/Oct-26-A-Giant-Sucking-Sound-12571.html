<h1>A Giant Sucking Sound</h1>
<p><i>Sat, <span class="created">October 26, 2002</span></i></p>
        <p>While I'm in favor of NAFTA, and free trade over all, it's certainly 
        not helping US workers. Instead, it favors US corporations as they made 
        use of cheaper labor. Of course, it's the corporations that also seem to 
        make out on these deals, doesn't it? Similarly, the other &quot;giant sucking 
        sound&quot; I've heard lately are my friends moving to Redmond to work for 
        Microsoft. MS is using the recession to cherry pick the best and the 
        brightest in the industry. I can think of almost ten people I know 
        personally that have gone to Microsoft in the last six months. And these 
        aren't folks that were laid off and had to go, either (even though 
        everyone but Microsoft is laying off). These are good folks that had 
        good jobs, either as employees or as independents. One even owned half 
        of what was my favorite company in the whole world! So why are they 
        doing it? Why are they giving up their old lives to work at MS, often 
        moving to Redmond in the process?</p>
        <p>I think they're going for a variety of reasons. One is definitely the 
        safe harbor aspect. As an independent in the current economy, I have to 
        work my butt off to attract funding using self-promotion techniques that 
        I didn't have to use during the Internet boom. I'm successful and I love 
        the work and the life, but it's still a lot of work that I know others 
        are not willing to do. Another reason related to the &quot;really hard work&quot; 
        problem is that Microsoft, for the caliber of my friends, is allowed to 
        offer what used to be a laughable salary, but is now looking pretty good 
        against what's generally available. If you can get 75% of what you used 
        to make as an independent, great benefits and stock options that may do 
        something someday, that's pretty compelling. And the stock price is 
        pretty attractive right now. It's my belief that, as a 
        government-sponsored monopoly, Microsoft is fundamentally sound, and the 
        stock price is artificially low. If you were going to go to Microsoft 
        any time in the last five years, now is the time. The stock is only 
        going to go up.</p>
        <p>But the big reason that makes people go, and this is the one that 
        might tip me some day, is the raw, visceral experience. For better or 
        worse, Microsoft is the mother ship from which everything we know now 
        has sprung. And they're still setting the tone. I know I dream of moving 
        to Redmond to work on the next technology that's going to kick ass in 
        2-3 years, like Don and Martin and Yasser did. I'd also love to live 
        where I am now, commuting to Redmond a week/month to work with developer 
        education, focusing on research and writing, like Tim did. Sometimes I 
        want to just chuck the extra effort it takes to stay &quot;outside,&quot; throw up 
        my hands and let the assimilation process begin.</p>
        <p>So, why haven't I thrown in the towel? I'm waiting. I'm waiting for 
        the perfect balance of quality of life where I get to spend every day 
        doing exactly what I want, working with a team on a long-term project 
        that I really believe in, but without the politics or the management 
        responsibilities that I deplore and without giving up my family or 
        dropping significantly in income. Right now I've got that all nailed 
        except for the team and the long-term project, so I've got it damn good, 
        but I'm still looking. Who knows? Maybe I'll get caught in the mass geek 
        migration to Redmond some day, but not yet...</p>
