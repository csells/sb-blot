<h1>A clickable button</h1>
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/scrapbook/ClickableButton.asp">Here</a>. "As useful and as popular as Chris Maunder's "An unclickable button" article and class is, I thought that a clickable button might also be useful. While my ClickableButton class is implemented specifically for .NET, the very same techniques can be used in nearly every object-oriented windowing library."
