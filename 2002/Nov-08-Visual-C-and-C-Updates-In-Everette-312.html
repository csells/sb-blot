<h1>Visual C++ and C# Updates In Everette</h1>
<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-965046.html">Here</a>. From Jesse Ezell: That release of Visual C# will include four new features: support for "generics," which is a form of a C++ template that can help C# developers build software more quickly; support for "iterators," which help developers create new code; anonymous methods, which ease development of whatâ€™s known as "event-driven" code; and support for "partial types," which make it easier to use C# for building large projects.
