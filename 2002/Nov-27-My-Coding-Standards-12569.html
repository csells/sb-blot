<h1>My Coding Standards</h1>
<p><i>Wednesday, <span class="created">November 27, 2002</span></i></p>
        <p>Sometimes it's like I'm a war veteran in my head. I'll be going 
        along, minding my own business, when *bang*! out of nowhere, a flashback 
        from my days as the director of a software organization hits me right 
        between the eyes. When it happened today, I thought it would be 
        therapeutic to talk about it instead of trying to bury it when these 
        &quot;episodes&quot; intruded on my normal life.</p>
        <p>The nice thing about setting up your own software organization is 
        that you get to set your own rules, and this time &quot;do it right.&quot; I had 
        always planned on getting my engineers together one day and coming up 
        with a common coding standards document, just like every software 
        organization had, but in the interim, we started with this one:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>All code will use spaces instead of tabs.</li>
          <li>All new code in an existing file will match the existing style.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Rule #1 nicely handles the case where different editors expand tabs 
        to different spaces, causing code that was easy to read when it was 
        written to go all crazy. Rule #2 says not to waste time reformatting 
        existing code into your own style, but to mimic the coding style that 
        was used by the original author. Rule #2 had the unexpected side effect 
        of helping developers get into each others' heads, which helped transfer 
        knowledge between us. I personally learned a bunch of cool tricks by 
        fixing bugs in files in the style of the original author.</p>
        <p>After a few attempts at adding other, more traditional rules to this 
        short list, like where the braces go and how to name variables, we 
        couldn't find anything that was worth ruining the simplicity of our 
        two-rule coding standards with, so that's what I've used ever since. One 
        other benefit of this simple set of coding standards was that it left us 
        all kinds of time to debate the merits of various text editors, which is 
        an argument that won't be solved until just after the Christianity vs. 
        Judaism debate is ended...</p>
