<h1>More Reaction from Microsoft</h1>
<span class="created">2/18/2002</span>
<p>I've heard from several of my friends at Microsoft (and yes, I do have some...), that Microsoft is not such a terrible place to work, but nobody puts it better than <a href="mailto:mbyron@microsoft.com">Mike Byron</a>: </p><blockquote><p>&quot;Huh. Ran into your Web page about Microsoft. I gotta comment on one thing I saw there: </p><p>'Over the years I've been collecting interview questions from Microsoft. I guess I started this hobby with the intent of working there some day, but now that I have a wife and two kids, that's pretty much out of the&nbsp;question.' </p><p>&quot;Baloney. I've been working at Microsoft for almost 5 years. I&nbsp;have a wife&nbsp;and twin 7-year-olds. I have an active church life. I work around 40-45&nbsp;hours per week, and have for the whole time. I have a GREAT time at&nbsp;Microsoft.&nbsp;I'm a veteran of Silicon Valley. Been creating mostly systems software&nbsp;since 1977. Microsoft is no different from most Silicon Valley&nbsp;companies --better hours than most startups, more driven than HP. I do work an&nbsp;occasional 50-55 hour week close to ship time. </p><p>&quot;Now, there are people that work here with completely different stories. But&nbsp;I am in no wise unique. I have lots of friends in basically the same&nbsp;position -- 40 hour weeks.&quot; </p></blockquote><p>Thanks for the quote, Mike. I'll try not to get you into &quot;trouble...&quot; </p><p>
