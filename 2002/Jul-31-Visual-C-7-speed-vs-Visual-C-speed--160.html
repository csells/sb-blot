<h1>Visual C++ 7 speed vs Visual C# speed </h1>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&frame=right&th=5f2376f49555ab3f&seekm=kfmckus6ho17srurjd68eheml9q9fia8sl%404ax.com#link1">Here</a>. "I did a rough experiment the other day with strange results. I created two console apps one is C# and the other if Visual C++ 7. The apps do calculations for Generation of the Mandelbrot Set and time how long it takes. The strange thing is that the Visual C# App is much faster than the C++ App. (1.5 secs per set for the C# App and 1.9 secs per set for the C++ App). This seems totally bizarre to me as I would have thought it would be the opposite. It puts me in the strange situation of thinking about rewritting my C++ fractal generator in C# to get more speed !!"
