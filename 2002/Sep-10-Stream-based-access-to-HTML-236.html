<h1>Stream based access to HTML</h1>
<a href="http://www.devhawk.net/htmlreader.htm">Here</a>. From Harry Pierson: Implemenation of an XmlReader-like class but for HTML. Most sites (like this one) that accept anonymous user input (like this entry) don't allow HTML tags because of the possiblity of scripting attacks. With the HtmlReader class, you could easily scan the HTML stream to ensure only specified and safe tags are used.
