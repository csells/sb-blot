<h1>Development for Developers</h1>
        <p>I got an email today from David, who says, <b>&quot;So, I am looking to 
        see what I can do to develop my skills as a designer. The trouble that I 
        have, is simple. Where does a programmer that is over 40 years old, with 
        a good job, and a good family turn to to learn something like this?&quot;</b></p>
        <p>David, developing in any career means taking risks, trying new 
        things, making mistakes. Some specific things you can do to improve your 
        developer/designer skills include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Examine your goals.</b> Do you want to be a better coder, a 
          better designer, a better tester? What's better to you? Fewer lines of 
          code? More lines of code? Faster code? More readable code? More 
          documentation of code/design? More thorough designs? More testable 
          code? More unit tests? Set yourself a list of goals and examine it on 
          a regular basis to keep yourself on track.</li>
          <li>Read some books and articles, like Writing Solid Code, and <b>re-write some of 
          your own code using the techniques you've read</b>.</li>
          <li>Pick your favorite feature in your favorite application. Design 
          it. Implement it.</li>
          <li><b>Read and review other peoples code</b> to see what they do, 
          especially in languages and task you're unfamiliar with to get a 
          different point of view.</li>
          <li>Pick a bug out of the bug database. Find the real cause. Find the 
          implementation mistake that caused it. Find the design mistake that 
          caused it. Change the implementation and/or design to find other 
          similar bugs in your code base. <b>Change the design/implementation to 
          make similar bugs impossible in the future.</b></li>
          <li>Run a code review to <b>get your peers' feedback on your code</b>.</li>
          <li>Get together with a group of developers at your job for <b>weekly 
          lunch lectures</b>. Teaching someone is a great way to learn.</li>
          <li><b>Take the time to really do something &quot;right.&quot;</b> You can't 
          always do this due to other real-world constraints, but if you never 
          do it, you're much less likely to get things right in the future.</li>
          <li><b>Take the time to follow your &quot;fetishes.&quot;</b> I can't tell you 
          how often I've followed up on something that didn't have anything to 
          do with what I was doing, but I just couldn't leave it alone, and then 
          it dove-tailed with something else I needed to do almost immediately. 
          Most of this web site is a result of following this advice.</li>
          <li><b>Attend a conference</b> and ask a lot of questions. Really 
          drill the speakers to make sure you &quot;get it&quot; (especially if it's me : 
          ).</li>
          <li><b>Write an article on something</b> and send it around to your peers or 
          put it up on the web. Writing about something is the only thing I can 
          think of that's better than teaching as a way for you to learn.</li>
          <li>Hang out on the mailing lists and news groups, but only answer 
          questions you don't know the answers to. <b>Don't worry about being 
          wrong and thank everyone who shows you when you are.</b></li>
          <li>Write a hunk of freeware/shareware/open source software and <b>put 
          your software up on the web</b> along with an installer and documentation. Maintain it.</li>
          <li><b>Find yourself a mentor.</b> Ask lots of questions and get them 
          to review your work. I've had a number of mentors of my own over the 
          years (Mike Woodring, Paul Crutcher, Don Box, Tim Ewald, John Robbins) 
          and it's made a world of difference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you'd like some &quot;hands on&quot; guidance to improve your skills as a 
        developer, I'm available as a mentor. I've 
        mentored a number of folks over the years and they've had
        some nice things to say about the 
        process. But don't feel you need me to take advantage of  these tips. <b>Take risks, try new things, make mistakes.</b></p>
