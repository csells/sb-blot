<h1>.NET ANY where, ANY time and on ANY device </h1>
<p>From Razvan Caciula:</p>
<p>"The objective for the <a href="http://www.halcyonsoft.com/products/iNET.asp">iNET</a> development team is to re-create the complete .NET deployment framework entirely in Java."</p>
<p>"For instance with iNET, corporations can deploy .NET based applications integrated with a J2EE server hosted completely on an IBM mainframe and/or Linux instead of Windows."</p>

<p>Anyone has used this mixture? :)</p>
