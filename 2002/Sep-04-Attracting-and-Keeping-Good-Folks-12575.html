<h1>Attracting and Keeping Good Folks</h1>

        <p>A friend of mine requested an essay on my thoughts of attracting and 
        keeping good employees. I've had the privilege of working with some of 
        the best and the brightest over the years and seeing how companies hire 
        and keep them. My take is that companies that attract the best do so 
        with a reputation of excellence. As one example, Google has kick-ass 
        technology, so I'm sure most of you want to work there (I know I do : ). 
        On the other hand, there are plenty of companies that have a reputation 
        for buggy, unusable software that turn us off, all without ever hearing 
        about the salary and benefits package.</p>
        <p>If you can attract good folks, you'll also attract lots of mediocre 
        folks and some not-so-good folks. There are all kinds of ways to screen 
        these folks out. My 
        favorite is to ask them &quot;why?&quot; questions. If they can tell me the name 
        of the operator that appears as a colon between the last paren of a C++ 
        constructor signature declaration and the opening curly place, that's 
        great. But if they can tell me why C++ has it, and why Java and C# 
        doesn't, they're hired. Of course, I let the interview candidate pick 
        their own area of expertise and ask them questions about what they know 
        best to see how deeply they've gone in their explorations. The ability 
        to figure out the &quot;why&quot; is a 
        necessary skill for folks that you're going to trust to take vague 
        requirements and come up with Google-like results in an environment 
        where no two consecutive projects use the same set of technologies (or 
        even similar ones, increasingly).</p>
        <p>To select for personality, as well as technology, I  like to whip
        <a href="http://staffingworld.com/intervie.htm">behavior 
        interviewing</a> questions on folks. Instead of sketching a situation 
        for an interviewee, e.g. &quot;how would you deal with conflict in the work 
        place?&quot;, behavioral interview questions ask people to remember real 
        situations they've been in and how they reacted, e.g. &quot;Imagine a time 
        when you had conflict in the work place. How did you handle it?&quot; 
        Everyone knows the right way to handle conflict in the work place, but 
        far fewer of them have handled it properly when it actually happened. 
        The idea of behavioral interviewing is that past behavior indicates 
        future behavior, so if you don't like that your candidate punched his 
        last manager in the nose, that's something to find out up front.</p>
        <p>Once a good person has been hired,
        <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
        keeping them is a matter of paying them what they're worth, letting them do what they're good at, 
        helping them get better at what they're not so good at, making sure you 
        don't waste their time on stuff that doesn't matter, showing 
        appreciation for a job well done and otherwise staying the hell out of their way.</span></p>
