<h1>Samples Chapters from the Web Services Implementation Guide</h1>
<a href="http://www.architag.com/press/wsig">Here</a>. From Stanford Powers: Getting value from stuff you don't own is a compelling idea. Just think, someone else has created something that has value, and has made it available to you. You can now leverage its value in ways that makes all parties richer. That's the promise of web services. 

Architag Press, a division of Architag International Corporation, announces the publication of Web Services Implementation Guide, Volume 1: Getting Started, by Brian E. Travis and Mae Ozkan.
