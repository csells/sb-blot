<h1>TechEd2002 Sessions / MS Videos</h1>
<a href="http://www.only4gurus.com/">Here</a>. From Jesse Ezell: If you are looking for a place to brush up on your .NET skills and missed TechEd this year, you can see the TechEd 2002 sessions (like 200+ sessions with slides, video, and audio) from here, as well as check out some great Balmer videos like the infamous "developers! developers! developers!" chant. Definately a top notch resource.
