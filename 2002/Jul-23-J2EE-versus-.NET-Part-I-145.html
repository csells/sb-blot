<h1>J2EE versus .NET Part I</h1>
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-2002/jw-0628-j2eevsnet.html">Here</a>. From Keith Wedinger: Rumble in the jungle: J2EE versus .Net, Part 1 from JavaWorld.com.  Heard a lot about .Net versus J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition)? Wondering what that conflict means for you? Well, we wondered the same thing. So, drawing on our combined experiences from both sides of the fence, we put together an unbiased explanation as to how J2EE and .Net match up. Make no mistake, finding unbiased opinions is difficultâ€”both camps' marketing hype has kicked into overdrive. This two-part series will help you better understand how the two technologies differ and how they are alike, all in the context of building a Web application from design right through to deployment.
