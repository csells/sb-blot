<h1>Newsletters Are Hard!</h1>

        <p>As I write this, several thousand emails are being sent to the 
        initial list of SellsBrothers News newsletter subscribers. My motive (to 
        let folks know what was happening on the site without having to visit 
        every day) was pure, but if I would have know how hard it was going to 
        be to set the thing up, I don't that I would have started.</p>
        <p>It began with a simple form on the web site to take people's email 
        addresses, which were in turn emailed to me and sorted into a Outlook 
        folder. When that reached a couple thousand without yet having sent out 
        a single issue, I figured it was time to put it into a real database. 
        So, which a bit of data cleaning through VS.NET and Excel to get the 
        dates right, I plunked it into an Access that would serve as the 
        repository on my ISP-managed site. That was all fine and dandy but for 
        one problem: I had to send emails using the data from my own machine, 
        not the machine with my live site (and therefore the latest subscriber 
        data). Did I really want to download an Access database from my ISP 
        every time I needed to send a newsletter? It won't be often, I admit, 
        but that still seems wrong, doesn't it?</p>
        <p>So, I paid the extra $10/month to get SQL Server support on my site 
        and worked with a friend of mine (<a href="http://www.crutchers.com/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Paul 
        Crutcher</a>) to build the form to take name, email address and HTML vs. 
        Text settings. Except it's not just one form. To make sure that folks 
        aren't subscribing other folks, we send out a confirmation email with an 
        URL in it that updates the database and shows another form indicating 
        whether that worked or not. Then, in case anyone changed their mind, we 
        needed another form to change subscription settings along with another 
        form letting them know that their changes were made. Of course, before 
        we could let them change their settings, we needed to let them log in, 
        which was another form. And, if they forgot their password, they need 
        another form so that they can enter their email address and we can send 
        it to them. Further, if the worst happens and they tire of my musings, 
        they need to be able to unsubscribe themselves.</p>
        <p>Not only did Paul build all of these forms, but he built them in two 
        parts, a form part and a control part, so that I could update the form 
        part to have the sellsbrothers.com look 'n' feel, while leaving the real 
        logic in the control part untouched (and potentially reusable). All in 
        all, just letting folks manage their newsletter subscriptions was 46 
        hunks of HTML packaged as .htm, .aspx and .ascx files. 46! I would have 
        downloaded something and integrated it, but I never found anything to do 
        the job (and this is where I get a hundred emails showing me the error 
        of my ways... : ).</p>
        <p>Of course, all that user-managed subscription work was to avoid one 
        thing: angry emails. I didn't want folks who'd forgotten they subscribed 
        many months ago or, worse, folks that were subscribed implicitly from 
        other activities like the <a href="/conference">DevCon</a>, to find 
        themselves on a list with no way to get off of it except for sending me 
        angry emails. That's just how insecure I am. : )</p>
        <p>So, after a few weeks of Paul and I working on the pages to do the 
        administration for me, I thought that the hard part was over. I was 
        wrong. While I did have an SQL database on my site, it was still nearly 
        empty. There were some folks who were newly subscribed after the new 
        code went live, but all of the folks who'd subscribed before then were 
        stuck in an Access database. &quot;That's OK,&quot; I thought. &quot;SQL Server and 
        Access were made by the same folks. I'm sure I won't have any problems 
        moving the data.&quot; That was two weeks ago. It took tons of advice from my 
        database friends (thanks
        <a href="http://staff.develop.com/bobb/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
        BobB</a> and
        <a href="http://www.adoguy.com/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
        ShawnW</a> and
        <a href="http://www.mcwtech.com/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
        BrianR</a>!), along with a final push from my brethren on the
        <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
        Off Topic Mailing List</a> to get the data moved to the right place. The 
        good news is that I got to polish my T-SQL skills a bit and I got to 
        play with DTS and the Enterprise Manager (both very nice pieces of 
        software).</p>
        <p>But that's not all. Once I had the subscribers in the database, I 
        then had to send several thousand emails, sorted into folks that want 
        HTML and folks that want Text, keeping track of bad email addresses. 
        This time, I went looking for a commercial product to do the job. I 
        figured that since my inbox was full of spam (<a href="http://www.cloudmark.com">SpamNet 
        is my new best friend!</a>), that there must be really great tools for 
        sending emails by the boatload. And again, my friends on the Off Topic 
        mailing list were there to help with a recommendation of the
        <a href="http://www.mailutilities.com/adr" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
        Advanced Direct Remailer</a>. ADR is also a nice piece of software that 
        comes out of the box configured <i>almost </i>right, but not quite and 
        the documentation has to be read very carefully. ADR is an SMTP server 
        that takes mail from your mail client and forwards it to a list of folks 
        based on who you sent it to. For example, you can send it to foo@localhost 
        where &quot;foo&quot; is a mailbox that resolves to a list of email addresses in a 
        text file or you can send it to bar@localhost where &quot;bar&quot; is a mailbox 
        that resolves to a select statement from a database. That all works 
        great, except if you get any of the settings at all wrong, ADR starts 
        acting like a real email server and just tries to send the email to foo@localhost. 
        Well, actually, it can't be foo@localhost for me, since I'm using 
        Outlook XP, a marvel of software engineering that in it's infinite 
        wisdom prohibits me from sending an email to a server without a &quot;.&quot; in 
        it. So, I send an email to foo@127.0.0.1, which ends up in ADR, but the 
        default settings only resolve requests sent to &quot;localhost&quot;, so ADR won't 
        do the queries. However, it is talking to the built-in SMTP server on my 
        machine (which I need for testing my web site before publishing it), so 
        it looks like it's doing something, making it even harder to figure out 
        what's going on, since I've never seen what ADR does when it works 
        correctly.</p>
        <p>When I finally do get everything right and the emails are queued in 
        ADR properly, I can tell it's going to take hours of 100% CPU 
        utilization for the newsletter to get out, so I go on to something else. 
        But I can't stay away for very long, so I'm constantly logging into the 
        machine doing the sending via Terminal Services to check on the 
        progress. With the CPU fully utilized, all the failed TS connections (I 
        have to keep trying!) eventually crash the ADR machine, causing a panic 
        as I reboot. I needed have worried. ADR has kept everything logged and 
        picks up right where it left off before the crash. Truly an amazing 
        piece of software.</p>
        <p>Why do I feel like <a href="http://www.byte.com/">
        Jerry Pournelle</a> all of a sudden?</p>
        <p>Now, as I'm drawing this missive to a close, I'm getting half a dozen 
        emails from subscribers that wish to unsubscribe but can't because of 
        the peculiarities of the imported data vs. what I tested against. So, 
        the angry emails have started. Here's a particularly angry one:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Courier">Subject: Get me off your spam list</font></p>
          <p><font face="Courier">You are too much of a hassle to remove, you 
          lie about where you got my address, I do not trust you at all.<br>
          <br>
          I will prosecute you my every means possible if you do not remove my 
          address from your database.<br>
          <br>
          If I find out you spread my address, I will go after you for that.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Oh, well. I tried...</p>
