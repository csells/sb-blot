<h1>The .NET Show: The Developer Roadmap</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/Episode028/default.asp">Here</a>. "In today's episode, we talk with Thomas O'Grady and Kerry Carnahan about the .NET Developer Roadmap that they have developed to help Enterprise developers understand the best ways for them to properly acquire the skills they need for developing applications using .NET."

I haven't seen this episode yet, but I generally watch all episodes of The .NET Show and enjoy them.
