<h1>Object vs. XML</h1>

        <p>I was watching a group of folks present a new XML standard the other 
        day and I realized something for the first time: to XML folk, OO 
        languages are just script-like &quot;glue&quot; for connecting XML processing 
        steps, the &quot;Unix pipe&quot; of the new millennium, if you will. Integration 
        with OO languages is necessary to enable XML dominance, but that's an 
        accident of history. In the view of the XML zealot, OO will eventually 
        fall away and only pure, clean XML will be left in its place.</p>
        <p>As an OO guy, I find this view disturbing. As a general technology 
        wonk who sees the value of XML, I find this view unrealistic. Just so 
        you XML folks know, OO guys look at XML as a data transfer syntax and 
        that's all. OO guys are happy that XML is there, but they prefer to stay 
        away from it in favor of their nice, familiar OO environment.</p>
        <p>The problem, of course, is that many XML guys are so steeped in the 
        new world that they forget where they came from. To paraphrase the 
        Matrix, XML guys don't even see the angle brackets anymore -- they just 
        see blonde, brunette, redhead. OO guys, of course, *only* see the angle 
        brackets and prefer their artificial world-like simulation.</p>
        <p>The result of this massive gap between XML and OO folks is that the 
        great thing that the XML guys are building, i.e. a general-purpose 
        hierarchical data manipulation, transformation and interoperation 
        infrastructure, something that OO guys desperately need, is being lost 
        because the two groups don't know how to communicate with each other.</p>
        <p>So, to enable XML to dominate, XML folks have to be sneaky. Just like 
        OO finally took off in C++ when it provided a super-set of the 
        procedural programming in C, XML has to provide a super-set of OO 
        programming, down to the easy syntax and the compile-time type checking. 
        Only when you give the OO guys exactly what they already have can they 
        begin to see what new things you've given them.</p>
