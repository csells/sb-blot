<h1>Edsger Wybe Dijkstra: 1930-2002</h1>
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/UTCS/notices/dijkstra/ewdobit.html">Here</a>. "Dijkstra is renowned for the insight that mathematical logic is and must be the basis for sensible computer program construction and for his contributions to mathematical methodology. He is responsible for the idea of building operating systems as explicitly synchronized sequential processes, for the formal development of computer programs, and for the intellectual foundations for the disciplined control of nondeterminacy. He is well known for his amazingly efficient shortest path algorithm and for having designed and coded the first Algol 60 compiler. He was famously the leader in the abolition of the GOTO statement from programming."
