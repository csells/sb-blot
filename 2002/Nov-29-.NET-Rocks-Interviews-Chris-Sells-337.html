<h1>.NET Rocks Interviews Chris Sells</h1>
<a href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks.asp">Here</a>. "Chris talks with Carl and Mark about COM and .NET components, finalizers, disposing, Smart Client Windows Forms Applications (we still don't know what to call these things), how to navigate sellsbrothers.com, interview weed-out questions, and why he calls it Sells Brothers. Also, Chris finally clears up the age-old question of why C++ programmers feel so superior to mere humans."
