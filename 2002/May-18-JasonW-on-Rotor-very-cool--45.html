<h1>JasonW on Rotor (very cool!)</h1>
"With over 9,000 files, and including some 1300 public classes to pore through, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/07/SharedSourceCLI/default.asp">the Shared Source CLI</a> can teach you quite a bit about the internal workings of the CLR. But the sheer amount of source code included can make just starting your exploration a monumental task. This article discusses some of the things you can learn from the source code facsimile of the CLR, like how JIT compilation works. It will also help you understand how to control execution along with debugging and loading classes. A walk through the steps involved in setting up the runtime will let you become familiar with the process."
