<h1>Object vs. XML</h1>
<a href="/12582">Here</a>. "I  was watching a group of folks present a new XML standard the other day and I realized something for the first time: to XML folk, OO languages are just script-like 'glue' for connecting XML processing steps, the "Unix pipe" of the new millennium, if you will. Integration with OO languages is necessary to enable XML dominance, but that's an accident of history. In the view of the XML zealot, OO will eventually fall away and only pure, clean XML will be left in it's place."
