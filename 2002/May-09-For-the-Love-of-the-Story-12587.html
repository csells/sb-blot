<h1>For the Love of the Story</h1>

        <p>It's only happened a few times in my entire life, but I want it to 
        happen more. It's that feeling you get when you're telling a story, 
        trying to describe a scene or a technology or a something and, suddenly, 
        without warning, it starts to tell you. It happened twice in college in 
        a creative writing assignment: one of those times it actually gripped me 
        from the moment I started writing my  life story on a 3x5 card (I 
        remember it started &quot;I was an accident.&quot; : ). It happened once while 
        writing ATL Internals: Chapter 7, Collections and Enumerations. And it 
        just happened again while finishing up a writer's journal entry I started 
        yesterday:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><blockquote>
  <p>Whack-thump-thump. Whack-thump-thump. The sound 
          filled the first floor. Whack-thump-thump. Tom knew he wasnt supposed 
        to play ball in the house. Whack-thump-thump. His father, watching from 
        the kitchen, had laid down that law several times when things had gotten 
        out of hand. Whack-thump-thump. The ball continued hitting his hand, the 
          floor and the door in 
        the never-never land between the kitchen and the front entry. 
        Whack-thump-thump. Tom, at 6, seemed to be using the mesmeric sounds to 
        enter another place, somewhere regular, somewhere safe, somewhere 
        comfortable. He had always been able to enter that place, whether he 
        was playing with action figures, with clay or even with ordinary items 
        like pencils or popsicle sticks, using them in the theater taking place 
        in his head. Whack-thump-thump. Whack-thump-thump. His father was a much more 
        literal thinker. He was creative, but creative in an 
        engineering/problem-solving way and he envied his sons ability to enter 
        this world seemingly effortlessly, never getting bored when the ordinary 
        world around him failed to offer what was safe and regular and 
        comfortable. Whack-thump-thump. Whack-thump-thump.</p>
</blockquote>
        <p>I started writing this to describe what my son Tom was doing 
        yesterday morning just before school and it turned into a look into how 
        much I loved and admired my 6-year-old son. He's so much different than 
        me, but just like his mother and looking at him makes me realize just 
        how much I love my wife. That's what writing is supposed to do. It's 
        supposed to help you reach into your self and share what you've got with 
        others. That's what this blog is all about and I appreciate you being 
        here to listen.</p>
