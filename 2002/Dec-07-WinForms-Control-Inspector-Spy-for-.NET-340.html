<h1>WinForms Control Inspector -- Spy++ for .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/controlinspector.asp">Here</a>. "ControlInspector hooks on to all events on a given control, user-control or form and shows when they are fired, along with any eventargs. It even handles custom events and custom event args using dynamically generated assemblies."

This looks *very* cool and was inspired by DevelopMentor's Guerrilla .NET course. Wahoo!
