<h1>Intel Rich Client Series</h1>
<a href="/public/writing/#intel">Here</a>. I'd like to announce a new series of articles specially requested by Intel on the topic of making the most of the client tier. Topics include high-performance graphics, data and XML querying and filtering on the client-side, smart client deployment and more. Two articles are up now with more to come through the end of the year. Enjoy.
