<h1>ASP.NET View State Decoder</h1>
<a href="http://www.develop.com/devresources/resourcedetail.aspx?type=t&id=827">Here</a>. "Have you ever wondered what was *really* stored in the view state of your .aspx pages? Well, now you can find out with the free view state decoder utility [1]. Just type in the URL of the page whose view state you would like to decode, and view the contents of the view state through a tree-view, as raw text, or as parsed XML. You can also copy and paste the view state string by hand to decode it. For a screenshot of this utility in action, check out: http://staff.develop.com/onion/images/decoderscreenshot.gif"

I've used this and loved it. It works a treat!
