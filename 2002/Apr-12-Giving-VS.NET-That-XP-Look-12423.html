<h1>Giving VS.NET That XP Look</h1>

    <p align="left"><i><b>USE THIS FILE WITH CARE. It causes problems with image 
    lists for .NET EXEs that don't also use the same manifest file.</b></i></p>
    <p align="left">Just drop this <a href="/public/tools/devenv.exe.manifest.zip">
    devenv.exe.manifest file</a> next to devenv.exe in your VS.NET install 
    directory and the next time you start VS.NET under XP, it'll look mostly the 
    same! (well, maybe a little different : )</p>
