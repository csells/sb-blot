<h1>.NET Data-Bound TreeView Control</h1>
<a href="http://www.abderaware.com/">Here</a>. "DataViewTree is a UserControl that can load hierarchical datasets into a Windows Forms TreeView control. The included sample project shows how to load an xml file into a dataset which is then passed to the DataViewTree control for display.

Complete source for the DataViewTree control and sample project is included in the download."

I know lots of folks want to data bind hierarchical data and this one includes the source if it doesn't do exactly what you're after.
