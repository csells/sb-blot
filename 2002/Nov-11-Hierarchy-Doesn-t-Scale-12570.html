<h1>Hierarchy Doesn't Scale</h1>
<p><i>Sun, <span class="created">November 11, 2002</span></i></p>
        <p>I was just chatting with a friend of mine and he said that he really 
        wanted to write a namespace extension so that he could expose a 
        hierarchy of data in the shell. Back when namespace extensions were 
        introduced with Win95, I thought that everything could be 
        integrated into the shell, making the shell the last application. 
        Sometime in the last seven years, I've come to hate that idea. As a 
        hardcore computer geek, I've embraced the hierarchy organizational 
        styles in three major applications:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Email folders (I keep things filed in a multi-level hierarchy and 
          use my Inbox as a to do list)</li>
          <li>The file system (I keep things filed in a multi-level hierarchy 
          and use my Desktop as a to do list)</li>
          <li>Free-form outline program (I keep things filed in a multi-level 
          hierarchy and use a file called todo.txt as a to do list)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As anal as I am about arranging and categorizing things into their 
        various hierarchies (and as many places as I've spread my to do list to, 
        apparently), the hierarchy only helps me about 50% of the time. I spend 
        just as much time searching for things as I do going right to where it 
        &quot;should&quot; be.</p>
        <p>The hierarchy used to be lots more helpful, but as the data I keep 
        around grows over the years, it becomes less and less possible to 
        remember where something really &quot;belongs&quot; and to find it there. In fact, 
        I've come to believe that a hierarchy is a terrible way to keep data 
        organized at all. A hierarchy is really just a way to associate key 
        words (called &quot;folder&quot; names) with hunks of data (called &quot;files&quot;) and 
        then only showing them in a very limited way. Searching is a 
        possibility, but it either takes a long time (because file indexing is 
        turned off) or it misses files (because file indexing is turned on -- 
        what's with that, anyway?). Searching creates an ad hoc logical folder, 
        but there's no way in the shell to create a permanent logical folder 
        with custom content.</p>
        <p>The basic hierarchy structure is easy to understand, but things 
        become much more powerful if I can keep one hunk of data in multiple 
        locations. Some versions of the Windows file system support this , but 
        the shell doesn't (although it can be simulated with shortcuts). Also, 
        the same kind of &quot;pivot table&quot; capability that Excel provides, mixed 
        with a much faster, more flexibly searching capability of a database, is 
        much closer to what I'm after. Hopefully Longhorn will provide something 
        like this.</p>
        <p>Also, being able to search all three of 
        my hierarchical&nbsp; data sources at the same time would be pretty damn 
        useful, but one thing at a time...</p>
