<h1>X-Code .NET: writing code with code for .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.arithex.com/xcc.html">Here</a>. "X-Code .NET is a successor to the popular "X-Code" codegen language, which was included as part of the excellent-but-now-defunct product from DevelopMentor known as Gen<X>.  X-Code .NET is like classic X-Code, except that it's based on JScript .NET instead of classic JScript."

I'm very happy to see Shawn, a valued member of the DevelopMentor Software team that built Gen<X> in the first place, take up this project. You go, Shawn!
