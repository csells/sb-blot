<h1>.NET CollectionGen</h1>

    <p>[Note: As of 5/5/03, the functionality of CollectionGen has been sucked 
	into <a href="http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith/">Eric 
	Smith's CodeSmith</a>. I asked Eric to take on these features because 
	CodeSmith does all of what CollectionGen does and more. All new feature 
	requests/bug reports should go his way.]</p>
	<p>CollectionGen is 
    <a href="/public/tools/collectiongen.zip">a Custom Tool Add-In to VS.NET 2002 &amp; 2003 to generate type-safe collections</a>. As it turns out, I did almost none of 
the work. <a href="mailto:jfland@develop.com">Jon Flanders</a> figured out how to add a custom tool. 
    <a href="mailto:shawnv@arithex.com">Shawn Van Ness</a> 
implemented
    the template for type-safe collections. I just put it together.</p>
    <p>CollectionGen is an add-on to generate code for type-safe collections 
    until we have templates in C# (likely) and VB (unlikely). The benefit of a 
    type-safe collection, of course, is that you can use it without having to 
    cast items to and from objects. Also, Shawn has been very careful to 
    implement a collection class that is very efficient for both reference types 
    and value types.</p>
    <p>Once you've setup it up and defined your collections in a collection 
    definition file in your project, you'll have type-safe collection classes 
    generated as part of your design-process, as shown here:</p>

	<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=ef3d0a73-0468-46da-8780-ede0f12b6f22">
	a generic VS.NET code generator shim</a> that allows you to build a code 
	generator that plugs into VS.NET by implementing a single method.</p>
