<h1>Keep On Cookin'</h1>

        <p>I got a very nice email  today from Ross Lambert:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;I'm a new fan of yours, both in terms of your technical abilities 
        and the down-home honesty of your columns in The Spout. I loved 'Of Eggs 
        and Omelets', mostly because I could identify with it. My own career has 
        been littered with a lot of broken eggs. I ran my own little software 
        company for nearly 10 years, writing and selling developer libraries for 
        Macintosh developers. Needless to say, the ups and downs of that market 
        were fairly impossible to survive.<br>
        <br>
        So now I am enjoying the Dark Side, as Mac folks would say. I'm a total 
        .NET-head, hence my fairly recent acquaintance with your work.<br>
        <br>
        Anyway, all that to say 'Don't let the turkeys get you down.' I was a 
        pretty decent marketer; I still write ad copy for different folks from 
        time to time. It was the only way I could manage to survive as long as I 
        did. For what it is worth, I think your approach is innovative and fun. 
        A few anal people will object (it sounds like they already have), but 
        I've come to the conclusion that about 2% of the population actually 
        enjoys being uptight and offering angry complaints. You'll never make 
        those folks happy, and it is just as well to give them a reason to bail 
        out early in the game.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
        <p>Thanks for that, Ross. While Of Eggs and Omelets speaks of breaking 
        eggs as metaphor for the negative feedback I've gotten from my recent series of 
        marketing-related emails, in truth only a tiny fraction of folks 
        complained. In fact, almost 10% of my newsletter subscribers responded 
        to my inquires in some positive way, which is about 50x the number of 
        people that had something negative to say. According to the marketing guy, getting a 10% response was about 3x what he was 
        hoping for (although he didn't tell me his expectations until *after* 
        the results were in... : ). Even more telling was the large number of 
        people that actually thanked us for asking. Apparently expressing 
        interest in their wants and needs was unique for a surprising number of 
        people. Further, the shear number of people interested 
        in the various ideas we proposed (like the
        <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/sellsbrothers/smalgroupmen.html">.NET 
        War College</a> and the
        <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/sellsbrothers/pionofwinpho.html">
        WinForms PhoneCon</a>) was only overshadowed by the number of people 
        with good ideas that we didn't even think of (which is what lead to
        <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/sellsbrothers/asktjewonk.html">Ask The 
        Wonk</a>).</p>
        <p>So, while I may have broken some eggs, and every one of those emails 
        physically pained me (how do spammers do it?!?), Ross and tons of others have 
        encouraged me to keep on making my omelet.</p>
