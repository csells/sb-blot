<h1>The Diminishing Importance of HTML </h1>
<a href="http://www.devx.com/codemag/articles/2002/JulyAug/DiminishingHTML/codemag-1.asp">Here</a>. "HTML-based Web development has dominated application development for the last six years or so and there are no signs of that changing. However, things are changing as the .NET initiative takes hold. Although Microsoft has put a lot of effort into its Web-based interfaces, which include the powerful new ASP.NET Web Forms framework, I am guessing that there will actually be a push back to desktop-driven, forms-based applications once .NET takes hold."
