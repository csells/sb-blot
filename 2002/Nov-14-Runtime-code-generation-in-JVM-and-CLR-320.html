<h1>Runtime code generation in JVM and CLR</h1>
<a href="http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/rtcg/index.html">Here</a>. From Hun Boon Teo: "The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the Common Language Runtime (CLR) are bytecode-based abstract stack machines. Since modern implementations include highly optimizing just-in-time (JIT) compilers, these machines are excellent targets for runtime code generation: the generation of new program code just prior to its execution."
