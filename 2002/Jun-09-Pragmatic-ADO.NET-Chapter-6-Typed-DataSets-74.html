<h1>Pragmatic ADO.NET, Chapter 6: Typed DataSets</h1>
<p>"In <a href="http://adoguy.com/book/samplechapter.aspx">Chapter 5</a>, I extolled the virtues of setting up your DataSets like in-memory databases. Unfortunately I asked you to write quite a bit of code to do all the work. I was only teasing you. This chapter will show you how to use Typed DataSets to make that job a lot easier while at the same time creating type-safety at compilation time."</p>
