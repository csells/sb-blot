<h1>My Chris Sells Is A Centerfold!</h1>
<a href="/12359">Here</a>. sttto Centerfold by J. Geils Band 

Yes, he walks, yes, he talks!
He'll be your Code Complete!
That ATL instructor
Sure could put 'em in the seats.

He could teach like no one else
No one could ever stain
The memory of that DM guy
Could never cause me pain

Years go by, I'm lookin' through a codin' magazine
And there's my DM buddy on the pages in between!
