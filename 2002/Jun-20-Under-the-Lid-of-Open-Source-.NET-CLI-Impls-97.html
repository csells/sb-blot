<h1>Under the Lid of Open Source .NET CLI Impls</h1>
<a href="http://www.devx.com/free/hotlinks/2002/ednote061902/ednote061902-1.asp">Here</a>. "Cross-platform .NET development is imminent, but the purpose, the feature set, and the platform support varies. We were curious about the development of the various open source implementations of Microsoft .NET's Common Language Runtime, so we talked to the key developers in charge of each of three CLI implementations—Mono, Rotor, and Portable .NET—to find out what exactly they've built, how they did it, and how they compare. What we found might surprise you."
