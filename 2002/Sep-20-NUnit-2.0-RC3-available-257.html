<h1>NUnit 2.0 RC3 available</h1>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=111615">Here</a>. From Bernard Vander Beken: From the release notes of this unit testing framework:

"This barring any unforeseen new critical bugs will be the last V2.0 release candidate. We will not
be adding any additional features until V2.0 is released which we expect now to be sometime around 26 September, 2002."
