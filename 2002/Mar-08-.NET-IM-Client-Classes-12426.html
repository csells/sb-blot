<h1>.NET IM Client Classes</h1>

    <p align="left">Inspired by my need to know who was calling without hauling 
    my butt off the couch to look at the caller ID on the phone across the room 
    (my father always said that &quot;laziness is the mother of invention&quot;),
    <a href="/public/tools/imcli.zip">I built a couple of C# classes for managing an IM 
    connection and an IM session</a>. The test client is a console application 
    that just sends messages and 
    dumps whatever it gets from the IM server to the console, but I think it 
    would serve as the code is the beginnings of a real IM client. 
    It does the MD5 stuff properly and handles being redirected to another IM 
    server, so the hard part of the protocol is already implemented. The sample 
    itself is a handy little program that logs in as an IM user, sends a message 
    to another IM user and logs back off again. Perfect for annoying your office 
    mates. Enjoy.</p>

    has made a number of updates to this core code to support his
