<h1>The Apple and the Tree</h1>

        <p>Yesterday my eight-year-old and I had the following conversation:</p>
        <p>John: &quot;Dad, do you know a lot about computers?&quot;<br>
        Dad: &quot;I know my share.&quot;</p>
        <p>John: &quot;But do you really know a lot?&quot;<br>
        Dad: &quot;I know pretty much.&quot;</p>
        <p>John: &quot;What buttons to you press to make that come up (pointing to 
        the Start button)?&quot;<br>
        Dad: &quot;Ctrl+Esc&quot;</p>
        <p>John: &quot;And how to you make it do Run?&quot;<br>
        Dad: &quot;Ctrl+Esc+R&quot;</p>
        <p>John: &quot;Cool.&quot;</p>
        <p>Cool indeed. : )</p>
