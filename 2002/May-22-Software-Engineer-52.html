<h1>Software Engineer</h1>
From Josep L Colom: Windows Forms or Web Forms?

I'm convicted that Windows Form approach is more suitable for ERP solutions. And I'm convicted also that they should be open (through Web Forms) for ocasional external access.
But ... what can I convict my 'not well documented' boss?
