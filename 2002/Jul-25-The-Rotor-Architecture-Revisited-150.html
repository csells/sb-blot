<h1>The Rotor Architecture Revisited</h1>
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/07/22/rotor.html">Here</a>. "Microsoft's Rotor project, recently refreshed on June 25, 2002, includes source code for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) execution engine and frameworks, as well as compilers and other developer tools. The Rotor code can be used, modified, and re-distributed, for non-commercial experimentation, as a basis for courseware or lab projects, or as a guide to those who are developing their own CLI implementations under a simple shared-source license."
