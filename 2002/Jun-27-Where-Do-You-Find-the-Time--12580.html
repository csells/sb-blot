<h1>Where Do You Find the Time?</h1>
        <p>I had lunch with a couple of colleagues on the lecture circuit today 
        and after they asked me  what I was working on (<a href="/public/tools/Genghis">Genghis</a>, the 
        <a href="/conference">Web Services DevCon</a> in October, 
        <a href="#refCountRotor">ref-counting for Rotor</a>, 
        <a href="/writing">a few books</a>, 
        some consulting,  etc), they asked where I found the time. 
        Here's how:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I work with a *ton* of very talented folks. The following are just 
          the ones I'm remembering off the top of my head that I've been working 
          with lately: Chris Tavares, Brad Wilson, Shawn Van Ness, Jon Flanders, 
          Don Box, Tim Ewald, all the Web Services DevCon speakers and staff, 
          all the Genghis contributors, Tim Tabor, Michael Weinhardt, Microsoft, 
          Dharma Shukla, Brian Harry, Chris Andersen, Mark Boulter, and, of course, all of my 
          former DevelopMentor 
          brethren.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>But most importantly, I don't attend meetings or request vacations 
          or approve vacations or attend meetings or receive reviews or give 
          reviews or attend meetings (did I 
          already say that?) or do any of the other things that employees have 
          to do. Skipping these activities easily doubles or triples my 
          productivity. Of course, I had to give up the steady paycheck to make 
          it happen and it's not the life for everyone, but it works for me just 
          fine. : )</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Real software engineering has so little to do with actual technology, 
        it's kinda sad. I'm lucky. I only have to do the technology part. My 
        question is, how do people with full-time jobs find the time to learn 
        the technology?</p>
