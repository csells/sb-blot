<h1>.NET XsdClassesGen</h1>

    <p align="left">XsdClassesGen is a <a href="/public/tools/XsdClassesGen.zip">Custom Tool 
    Add-In to VS.NET 2002 &amp; 2003 to generate type-safe wrapper classes for serializing to 
    and from XML documents</a>. It takes as input an XSD and produces the C# or 
    VB.NET code to do the serialization using the XmlSerializer. This is really 
    just the output of running xsd.exe /classes, but integrated directly into 
    VS.NET.</p>
