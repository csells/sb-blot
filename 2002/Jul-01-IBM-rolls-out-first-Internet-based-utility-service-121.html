<h1>IBM rolls out first Internet-based utility service</h1>
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/07/01/020701hnibm.xml">Here</a>. "IBM on Monday rolled out an Internet-based service that allows Linux users to access the amount of processing power and other technical resources they need on a utility basis. The new on-demand service, called Linux Virtual Services, directly connects users' Linux-based server applications with IBM's hosting centers, which can supply them with managed server processing, storage, and networked capacity on an on-demand basis."

This is how things *should* be.
