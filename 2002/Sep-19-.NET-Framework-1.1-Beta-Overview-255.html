<h1>.NET Framework 1.1 Beta Overview</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/productinfo/next/overview.asp">Here</a>. From Andrew Webb: Even if you don't want to download the beta, this article gives a nice overview of what to expect in the 1.1 version of .NET Framework.

Note the 'Developer Tools Roadmap' link at top-right of the Beta Overview page.

www.gotdotnet.com has an article about forwards and backwards compatibility between 1.0 and 1.1.
