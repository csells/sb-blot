<h1>Pet Shop 2.0: Java vs. .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.middleware-company.com/documents/j2eedotnetbench.pdf">Here</a>. The Middleware Company ran a comparison between the Pet Shop v2.0 application for both Java and .NET, both with the same features and both with the same aim at building something to use as a "best practice" sample while still being as responsive and scalable as possible. Pet Shop v2.0 was both company's attempt at winning the comparision run by the Middleware Company.

My reading of this report is that .NET kicked Java's hinder in every single measure, from through-put and responsiveness to lines of code and lines of configuration required to build and run the app.
