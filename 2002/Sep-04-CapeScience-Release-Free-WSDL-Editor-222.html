<h1>CapeScience Release Free WSDL Editor</h1>
<a href="http://www.capescience.com/downloads/wsdleditor/">Here</a>. "Cape Clear Software released a free graphical WSDL Editor for programmers interested in working with Web Services. The WSDL Editor delivers the first complete environment for rapid Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) development. It supports novice programmers, while also providing sophisticated features for more experienced Web Services developers. The Editor includes powerful wizards, which eliminate the complexity of WSDL, as well as WSDL validation which simplifies testing, and support for the rapid creation of Web Services from XML Schema."

We're on fire with free XML tools today! This one is cool because it's free and it allows you to define your web service's WSDL first like you should, just like defining your COM interfaces first in the old days.
