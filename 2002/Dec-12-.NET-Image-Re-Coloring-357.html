<h1>.NET Image Re-Coloring</h1>
<a href="/public/writing/DotNetImageReColoring.htm">Here</a>. "This code first sets up an array of ColorMap objects, each of which contain the old color to transform from and the new color to transform to. The color map is passed to a new ImageAttribute class via the SetRemapTable. The ImageAttribute object is then passed to the DrawImage function, which does the color mapping as the image is drawn."
