<h1>Of Eggs and Omelets</h1>

        <p>My life has been one long series of experiments. I tried to be a 
        know-it-all jerk in high school and found that this tended to cut into 
        my social life (drastically), so I stopped (or am still stopping, 
        depending on how well you know me : ). I tried to be a &quot;ground floor&quot; 
        employee for a small company, but that stopped being fun when the 
        repetition and bureaucracy hit and it became clear that any profits that 
        might someday happen would be kept at the owner level. I tried being an 
        employee for a large company, but when my projects started getting axed 
        based on political winds that, as a low-level grunt, I had no control 
        over, I went looking elsewhere. Then I found DevelopMentor. The 
        combination of working on lots of different things with lots of smart 
        people was something that I loved more than anything I've since found.</p>
        <p>But even that didn't stop my experimentation. After teaching and 
        consulting for a while, I decided that instead of just talking about 
        building software, that I would take one of my ideas and build a 
        software development team. There I worked to build the best software 
        development team that I've ever had the pleasure to work with and a 
        learned a *ton* along the way. However, the fact that the product itself 
        was a commercial failure didn't make for lasting employment.</p>
        <p>So, late last year, I started another whole series of experiments, 
        this time aimed at making myself solvent as an independent in a down 
        economy. I've been doing all kinds of crazy things to see if I could use 
        them to help build my brand, my business and my customer base. Some of 
        them have been critically acclaimed and a few have even been 
        commercially viable, at least to the point that I can continue to pay my 
        mortgage (many of my friends weren't so lucky). I have been successful 
        in that I've gotten to do a lot of cool things and work with a lot of 
        smart people.</p>
        <p>However, what I've found is that to remain independent, I have to 
        spend a lot more time doing promotion and marketing, which goes against 
        every fiber in my being. The problem is, although I've experimented a 
        bunch, especially as related to this year's DevCons, I don't have any 
        natural marketing aptitude and I don't know where to turn for help. So, 
        I fall back on my old standby -- experimentation.</p>
        <p>Over several years, I've experimented with several sales/marketing/PR 
        folks and organizations and so far, haven't found what I'm looking for 
        as far as &quot;mentors&quot; go (to be fair, my standard for comparison includes 
        Don Box, Tim Ewald and John Robbins, so I'm not surprised I haven't 
        found someone to meet that bar). Even if I did meet that person, or may 
        have already met him/her, I don't know that I'd recognize it. I just 
        have no standard for comparison. With software, it either works or it 
        doesn't. With marketing, did it succeed or fail because of the quality 
        of the product or the quality of the marketing? The whole thing is too 
        damn squishy and it drives me nuts!</p>
        <p>My most recent set of experiments is to let a friend of mine, a 
        long-time marketing guy that I've known for years, run rough-shod over 
        my newsletter subscribers, asking them all kinds of questions and for 
        their help in various ways, offering my money and my time as incentives. 
        Will it work? I have no idea. Is it risky? You bet. I've lost a dozen or 
        more subscribers and who knows what some people think of me now that 
        I've let marketing ideas into what I do (and I'd like to apologize again 
        to the folks that I drove away or offended in this most recent 
        campaign). Is it worth the risk? Yes it is, but not for the promised 
        return (I still think my marketing friend was on happy pills the day he 
        quoted his marketing targets). What makes it worth the risk is that I've 
        identified a weakness in myself and I'm willing to perform the 
        experiment and make the mistakes to see if I can come out better on the 
        other side. Even if I fail, I've learned something. Eventually, I'll get 
        that omelet made, no matter how many eggs need breaking.</p>
        <p>And to those of you who suffer with me through my experiments, thank 
        you very much. You have no idea how much you mean to me.</p>
