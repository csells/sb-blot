<h1>Library for reading CLI files</h1>
<a href="http://dotnet.di.unipi.it/MultipleContentView.aspx?code=103">Here</a>. "This library has been implemented to provide access to the raw format of CLI files. The library is still under development, so you can find some problem in its use. The library has been developed using CLI standard documentation. Because fast access to files is a goal I use memory mapping in order to have fast access to the file."
