<h1>treecc -- Free Compiler Construction Tool for C#</h1>
<a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/treecc_doc/treecc.html#SEC_Top">Here</a>. "The approach that we take with treecc is similar to that used by yacc. A simple rule-based language is devised that is used to describe the intended behaviour declaratively. Embedded code is used to provide the specific implementation details. A translator then converts the input into source code that can be compiled in the usual fashion."
