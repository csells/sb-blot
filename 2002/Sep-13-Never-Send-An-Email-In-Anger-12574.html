<h1>Never Send An Email In Anger</h1>

        <p>I learned how to write good emails at the foot of the master -- Don 
        Box. Whenever  we'd decide we wanted 
        something, he'd grab his computer and say, &quot;Let's write the email&quot; and 
        it would be done.</p>
        <p>One of the most important things that I've ever 
        learned about high-tech communications is to never, ever write an email 
        in anger. Or, to be more precise, never *send* an email in anger. I 
        encourage you to actually write it. It always makes me feel better. But 
        don't address it, because you want that email to first end up in your 
        Drafts folder and go from there to your Deleted folder. If you address 
        it and mean to press Ctrl+S to Save but manage to press Alt+S to Send by 
        mistake, you might well be looking for work in another industry. If you 
        don't address it, however, Outlook complains and you can breathe a sigh 
        of relief. Frankly, I wish there was an add-in that protected me even if 
        I ignore my own advice:</p>

        <p>Of course, this spouting could only occurred after I've violated my 
        own advise, as I've often done over the years, always to my determent. 
        When you're angry, all you care about is making sure that your anger 
        comes through. If I give myself an hour or two to think on it, when I 
        come back to read that angry email, it always makes me flinch. Writing 
        an email once I'm done being angry always yields the nicest, most 
        thoughtful emails that I can write. Those I find to be *much* more 
        effective.</p>
