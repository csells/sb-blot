<h1>SQL Server Centric .NET Code Generator</h1>
<p>"<a href="http://www.microsoft.fr/olymars/webupdate.xml">SQL Server Centric .NET Code Generator</a> (code named OlyMars) is both a flexible and powerful code generator based on database modeling.</p>

<p>"It allows instant generation of both SQL and .Net code providing a complete library of stored procedures, .NET classes and ready-to-use Windows/Web form controls (including associated documentation).</p>

<p>"SQL Server Centric .NET Code Generator is also fully extensible to use one's own custom templates and consequently can be adjusted to generate any custom code respecting a homogeneous implementation scheme within the company (can be written either in VB .NET or C# .NET)."</p>

<p>This seems to have punted on the multi-language issues, however. sigh.</p>
