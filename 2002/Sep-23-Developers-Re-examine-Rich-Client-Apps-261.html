<h1>Developers Re-examine Rich-Client Apps</h1>
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/appdev/story/0,10801,74450,00.html">Here</a>. From Michael Weinhardt: "Some corporate developers last week said they will consider switching from Web applications back to their old, familiar rich-client applications because of unpromoted features that they're just now discovering in Microsoft Corp.'s .Net framework."
