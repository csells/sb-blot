<h1>And They Said it Wasn't Ready For Production</h1>
<a href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=openlink_mono">Here</a>. From Jesse Ezell: "Ximian, Inc., the leading open source desktop company, today announced that OpenLink Software, Inc., an industry leader in the development and deployment of secure, high-performance Universal Data Access and Web Services middleware, is using Mono™ as part of the development efforts for Virtuoso 3.0, its latest Universal Server release. Mono enables OpenLink Virtuoso to provide a consistent .NET common language runtime (CLR) and frameworks integration implementation across Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and UNIX. The OpenLink effort demonstrates platform-independent web services creation using any .NET-bound language, web services hosting, ASP.NET application invocation without IIS, and ADO.NET based data access. OpenLink's adoption represents one of the first commercial uses of the Mono Project, a community initiative launched by Ximian™ to develop an open source version of the Microsoft .NET development platform for Linux and UNIX."
