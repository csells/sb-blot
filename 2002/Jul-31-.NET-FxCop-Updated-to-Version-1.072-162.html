<h1>.NET FxCop Updated to Version 1.072</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/libraries/">Here</a>. What's new:

"1) UI updated (i.e. exclude tracking info, bold `new' violations, application settings +more)

2) nearly every rule has been touched, most improved

3) addition of 40+ new rules

4) cmd-line version of tool greatly stabilized and improved

5) new, complete set of documentation"
