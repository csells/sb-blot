<h1>Code that begets code</h1>
<a href="http://www.iunknown.com/Weblog/Whenlessismore.html">Here</a>. From cn: "Chris Sells, who actually created a code generation product, was unable to convince me of the importance of code generation. Why did one of my friends succeed where the other failed?"

Rebuttal, please?
