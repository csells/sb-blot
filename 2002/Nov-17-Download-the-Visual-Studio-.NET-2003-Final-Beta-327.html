<h1>Download the Visual Studio .NET 2003 Final Beta</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/vstudio03/default.asp">Here</a>. "Be the first to try Visual Studio .NET 2003, which is currently in Final Beta and available for download from MSDNÂ® Subscriber Downloads."

"With integrated support for the .NET Compact Framework, Visual Studio .NET 2003 brings mobile and embedded devices such as the Pocket PC, as well as other devices powered by the Microsoft Windows CE .NET operating system, to .NET. Now, developers can use the same programming model, development tools, and skills to build applications that span from small devices to the largest data center."

The final beta of Visual Studio .NET 2003, aka the Everett version of VS.NET, is available for download by MSDN subscribers. Wahoo!
