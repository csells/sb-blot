<h1>Using ATL Server to Build Web Services</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/12/ATLServer/default.aspx">Here</a>. "[W]here is the unmanaged programmer to turn [for building web services]? The answer is ATL Server. Developers familiar with conventional COM programming using Visual StudioÂ® 6.0 and ATL 3.0 will find an extraordinarily empowering suite of tools and classes in the new ATL 7.0 library that comes with Visual Studio .NET.

This article will explain how the C++ programmer can use the facilities available in ATL Server to develop high-performance Web Services quickly."
