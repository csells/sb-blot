<h1>New .NET Remoting Open Source Project</h1>
<a href="http://www.dotnetremoting.cc/projects/">Here</a>. "We like .NET Remoting and its extensibility model. We want to show the world that you can do some pretty useful (and some weird) things with this model. We also like the ideas behind SOAP and web services but somehow believe that .NET Remoting is a superset of them and offers features which are needed by today's developers."

This open source site for .NET remoting extensions continues to grow with a new bi-directional TCP channel to work in firewall environments.
