<h1>.NET Wrappers for NVIDIA's Cg API</h1>
<a href="http://www.exocortex.org/cg">Here</a>. From Ben Houston: This simple wrapper, written in Managed C++, allows for developers to make use of NVIDIA's new Cg shader language from within a C# or VB.NET application.  It is simple to use with existing OpenGL wrappers such as Llyod Dupond's CsGL.  A sample application that makes use of OpenGL and Cg via C#, ExoEngine, is available for download on the same site.
