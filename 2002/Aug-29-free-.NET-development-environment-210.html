<h1>free .NET development environment</h1>
<a href="http://builder.com.com/article_guest.jhtml?id=u00220020821ton01.htm">Here</a>. From Hussein: As a Java developer, I was curious about the release of C#. Unfortunately, the list price of more than $1,000 for Microsoft’s developer environment, Visual Studio .NET, extinguished the appeal. I wanted to play with the language, but I couldn’t afford the investment. Thankfully, I discovered a free .NET development environment called SharpDevelop.
