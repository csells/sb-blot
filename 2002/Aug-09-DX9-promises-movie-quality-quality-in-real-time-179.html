<h1>DX9 promises movie-quality quality in real-time</h1>
<a href="http://www.ati.com/developer/demos/R9700.html">Here</a>. Check out the Animusic demo, which is a capture of a real-time animation demo using DirectX9 and an ATI Radeon 9700. Not only is it amazing graphics-wise, but's it's entertainment. If we can do this kind of thing in real-time, it won't take Pixar to do ToyStory, we can have it in our games or we can do it ourselves in our basements. This will do for animators what word processors did for authors and sequencers did for muscians.
