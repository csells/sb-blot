<h1>Mono Runs ASP.NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Here</a>. From Jesse Ezell: Ximian released mono 0.17 today:

"Many new features as well as plenty of bug fixes. Many new System.Data providers and a more mature System.Web (ASP.NET) which can now be hosted in any web server. A simple test web server to host asp.net has been released as well."
