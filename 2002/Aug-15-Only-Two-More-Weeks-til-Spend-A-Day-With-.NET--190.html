<h1>Only Two More Weeks 'til Spend A Day With .NET!</h1>
<a href="/public/fun/daywithdotnet/">Here</a>. There's only two more weeks to prepare (reading only - no coding!) for the "Spend A Day With .NET" Coding Content on August 30th.

Grand prize is free admission to the Web Services DevCon, but other prizes include a year subscription to MSDN Universal, a signed box copy of VS.NET, a half-day of consulting and free software and t-shirts galore!
