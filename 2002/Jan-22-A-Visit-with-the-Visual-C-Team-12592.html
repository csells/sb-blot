<h1>A Visit with the Visual C++ Team</h1>

        <p>I spent a fun two days up at Microsoft last week at the Visual Studio 
        .NET C++ Authors Summit, wherein the Microsoft team shows us how cool 
        VS.NET is for C++ and browbeat us to write a book on the topic. Since 
        I'm already planning to write ATL Internals, 2/e with
        <a href="mailto:kirk@pacificmindworks.com">Kirk Fertitta</a>, I couldn't 
        talk them out of the XBox I so richly deserve. On top of that, they 
        tortured me by taking me to the Microsoft store where they have XBox 
        games for only $10! Those bastards...</p>
        <p>If you're a C++ programmer, VS.NET/VC7 brings a lot to the table. And 
        according to <a href="mailto:nickhod@microsoft.com">Nick Hodapp</a>, a 
        PM on the VC team at Microsoft, many, many of you are C++ programmers. Microsoft 
        quoted some 3rd party studies that say that there are about 3M C++ 
        programmers out there (compared to 5M VB programmers and a whole lot 
        less Java programmers). From a 3rd party survey of 
         
        VC++ customers, Microsoft found that 90% (!) of them will be doing 
        the same or more VC++ work in the future (about 22 hours/week). They 
        also found that about 75% of VC++ users are MFC programmers (which isn't 
        growing) and 35% of them are ATL programmers (and is growing). Given the number of ATL7 books 
        shipping right now or in progress (ours and a few more), and the 
        increase in the audience, that  made Kirk, my Addison-Wesley 
        editor and me very, very happy.</p>
        <p>Here are some other interesting tidbits from that survey for you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>68% of VC++ developers build client-server apps</li>
          <li>61% build desktop apps</li>
          <li>51% build peer-to-peer apps (This number slays me. What are these 
          guys building?!?)</li>
          <li>36% build embedded/CE apps</li>
          <li>35% build NT services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we were there, various members of the VC++ team attempted to 
        rock our world in terms of the new and improved features VC7. Sometimes 
        they succeeded. For example, <a href="mailto:pranishk@microsoft.com">
        Pranish Kumar</a> told us how the ATL Server version of the Nile 
        benchmark web application was 10% faster than the hand-turned ISAPI 
        version in 1/4th the development time, which is why the Microsoft site 
        uses it for some of their &quot;through-put challenged&quot; areas. Also, Terry 
        Leeper showed us how make mini-dumps for VC++ projects that you can send to the 
        developer's who persist in saying &quot;but it works on my machine...&quot; He 
        also showed us how you can pause threads during debugging, load symbols 
        on demand, set breakpoints in DLLs that aren't loaded at start-up 
        (without that annoying dialog box) and just how much the new 
        optimization features can speed up your code (they did an amazing demo 
        with a recompiled Microsoft codedec that nearly doubled the frame rate 
        with no code changes).</p>
        <p align="left">For those of you into ANSI compliance, Microsoft showed 
        off an early internal build of their compiler that raises VC's over 
        all compliance rating  to among the highest in the 
        industry. They are able to compile all of the popular 3rd party template 
        libraries, e.g. Loki, Boost, Blitz++, POOMA and a complete STL.</p>
