<h1>Please Say "Why"</h1>

        <p>As .NET demands new books and articles and the economy has given a 
        lot of smart folk free time, the world is becoming inundated in .NET 
        books, articles, talks and courses, many of which I am tapped to review. 
        Some are wonderful. Some are awful. Most, however are *almost* good, the 
        path to goodness well within the author's reach but for the answer to one 
        question: &quot;why?&quot;</p>
        <p>Most of my feedback is riddled with questions that start with why: 
        &quot;Why was it built this way?&quot; &quot;Why are there three choices and how do I 
        choose?&quot; &quot;Why should I care?&quot; Please, when you write, remember this 
        question and answer it thoroughly and well. The why is *so* much more 
        important than the how. The online documentation for .NET is fabulous 
        for describing the how, once you understand the motivation for this 
        class, that method or the other namespace.</p>
        <p>Prose that provides the how is transient, but prose that provides the 
        why becomes classic because the why itself is surprisingly applicable 
        between technologies. At the very least, if you answer the why, it will 
        save me work if I'm to review your prose.</p>
