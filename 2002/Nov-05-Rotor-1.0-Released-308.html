<h1>Rotor 1.0 Released</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/sscli">Here</a>. "The 1.0 release builds and runs on Windows XP, the FreeBSD operating system, and Mac OS X 10.2. In addition, the release contains many bug fixes, more documentation, new samples and additional test suites."

For low-level .NET weenies (like me : ), this is the stuff, baby!
