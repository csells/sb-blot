<h1>NUnit 2.0 Released</h1>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10749&release_id=114369">Here</a>. From Bernard Vander Beken: From the readme:

"This is the second major release of the xUnit based unit testing tool for Microsoft .NET. It is written
entirely in C# and has been completely redesigned to take advantage of many .NET language features,
for example custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities."

"In the next few weeks we will be
formulating the next release trying to incorporate as many requests as possible."
