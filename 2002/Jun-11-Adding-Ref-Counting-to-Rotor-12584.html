<h1>Adding Ref-Counting to Rotor</h1>
        <p>Microsoft has granted Sells Brothers, Inc. a research grant to add 
        ref-counting to Rotor and to study the performance effects.
        <a href="/public/tools/RotorRefCounting.doc">The proposal that lead to that 
        grant is available here</a>. There's been a lot of speculation about 
        just how we're planning to add ref-counting to Rotor. Here are the 
        highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It's not just &quot;me,&quot; it's &quot;we.&quot; I've already have very useful input 
          from several folks, including Jason Whittington, Ted Neward, Ian 
          Griffiths, Serge Lidin, Craig Andera and Bill Conroy. Also, Chris 
          Tavares will be spending most of July doing the actual implementation. 
          If anyone else wants to dig in, feel free! I'm happy for the help and 
          anyone that provides insight will get credit.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>The goal of adding ref-counting to Rotor is to measure the 
          performance effects of a deterministic finalization-like model that we 
          gave up when moving from COM/C++/VB6 to .NET. I say &quot;DF-like&quot; because 
          we're not getting DF, because the price of determinism is that 
          sometimes an object is never finalized, e.g. cycles. We can do better.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>We will not be replacing the existing GC's ref-tracking. It does a 
          fabulous job managing memory and managing cycles and we won't touch 
          that.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>The ref-counting implementation's sole job will be to call an 
          object's finalizer ASAP. Note that this is in no way &quot;deterministic.&quot; 
          Plain ref-counting is deterministic in that it calls an object's 
          finalizer just as soon as there were no more outstanding object 
          references. Cycles meant that this would never happen 
          (deterministically). A hybrid ref-counting/ref-tracking system 
          improves &quot;never&quot; to &quot;eventually&quot; in the case of a cycle and maintains 
          the ref-counting's guarantee for ASAP in their absence.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Even objects that don't have finalizers will need ref-counts, as 
          they maintain references to objects that have finalizers (and so on).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Value types will not need reference counts, but when they go out 
          of scope, there will need to be a Release on any object references the 
          value objects contain.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>When the GC kicks in and finally breaks a cycle, it would be nice 
          to release all objects held by the cyclic objects so that they could 
          return to normal ref-counting determinism. However, since we've 
          already blown determinism by being in a cycle, this seems unlikely to 
          be very helpful. Also, by skipping this we can keep all of our changes 
          in the JITter and out of the GC, which simplifies the initial 
          implementation. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>We'd plan on adding ref-counting at the runtime level in the 
          JITter so that all languages gain the benefits w/o updating the 
          compilers (or mandating anything special in any language). The real 
          work is figuring out which IL instructions require AddRef/Release 
          calls and getting those calls into the instruction stream. Because of 
          this, we're not likely to be able to handle tail calls (at least, 
          initially). Anyone with advise in this area would be welcomed with 
          open arms.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>We plan on working nicely with existing IDispose-based code. Since 
          our ref-counting is all about calling the finalizer, if the ref-count 
          gets to zero and there is no finalizer to call, no finalizer will be 
          called. That means that Dispose implementations that call 
          GC.SuppressFinalize will not cause any problems with the ref-counter. 
          Of course, the goal is that the IDisposable.Dispose protocol is not 
          necessary at all.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>As a potential optimization, I have found a nice place to store a 
          7-bit ref-count in the existing space allocated to every object, so 
          there will be no space overhead, only CPU overhead. However, this 
          narrows the number of objects per&nbsp; process with synch blocks 
          and/or hash values from 134 million to 1 million. It also narrows the 
          number of referencing objects from the traditional 4 billion to 127. 
          Anecdotally, 127 seems like enough, but it will necessitate the need 
          to abandon ref-counting on any object that reaches 127 extent 
          references. Since most data structures where more than 127 references 
          could happen are parent-child, e.g. every child in a tree with a 
          reference to the root, and this indicates a cycle that can't be 
          handled by the ref-counting anyway, turning these objects over to the 
          ref-tracking portion of the algorithm seems reasonable. However, we 
          won't know 'til we look how many object references an object is going 
          to have, so we'll track maximum reference counts during our tests to 
          see if this optimization makes sense at all.</li>
        </ul>
