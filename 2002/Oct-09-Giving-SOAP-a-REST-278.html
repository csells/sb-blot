<h1>Giving SOAP a REST</h1>
<a href="http://www.devx.com/free/hotlinks/2002/ednote100902.asp">Here</a>. "Many developers will be surprised to learn that SOAP isn't the only game in town for Web services interfacing. REST offers a perfectly good solution for the majority of implementations, with greater flexibility and lower overhead. Developers need to stop reaching immediately for SOAP and start choosing the right technology for the application."

I thought that this article would be an interesting counter-point to Peter Drayton's "Designing a RESTful SOAP API" at the DevCon this week.
