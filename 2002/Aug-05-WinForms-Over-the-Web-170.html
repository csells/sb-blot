<h1>WinForms Over the Web</h1>
I did a talk at <a href="http://www.padnug.org">the local Portland Area .NET User's Group</a> on
zero-setup deployment of WinForms applications over the web, including versioning, caching, optimization, debugging and security. This talk is also an excerpt from 
<a href="http://develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=131">DevelopMentor's Essential WinForms course</a>, 
which I highly recommend (although I'm hardly unbiased : ).
