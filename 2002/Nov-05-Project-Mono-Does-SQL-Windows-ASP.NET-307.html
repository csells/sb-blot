<h1>Project Mono Does SQL / Windows / ASP.NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Here</a>. From Jesse Ezell: Project Mono can now execute SQL statements on MS SQL Server through TDS and has a bit of Windows.Forms code running on both Linux and Windows as well as a good deal of ASP.NET support. Looks like things are coming along at a decent rate.
