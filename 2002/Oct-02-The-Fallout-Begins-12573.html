<h1>The Fallout Begins</h1>

        <p><a href="#burnout">Two months ago</a>, I noted a fall in morale in 
        the IT industry amongst my friends and colleagues. I wondered whether 
        the best people in the industry who'd been fighting for a sane 
        development process, but living without it because people were handing out 
        cars as signing bonuses, would rather not work in another industry when 
        the cars were no longer available and the fight for what was right 
        didn't seem to make as much difference any more. Yesterday, one of the 
        people that I'd put into the &quot;right up there&quot; category,
        <a href="http://pinetree-tech.com/weblog/archives/2002/10/01.shtml#finally_figured_it_out">
        Justin Rudd, announced his intention to pack it in and go back to school 
        to be a doctor</a>. </p>
        <p>This kind of thing shakes my own faith. Should I continue to bust my 
        hump on the latest and greatest technologies or ditch it all and start 
        that novel I've got in the back of my head? I still really love doing 
        the former, but it seems that everyone has to work a lot harder for a 
        lot less these days. Maybe I just need to readjust my thinking, but 
        damn, being smack dab in the middle of an economic boom really does a 
        number on you! I feel like the guy who found a silver mine in the middle 
        of the gold rush. I don't have any trouble feeding my family and it's 
        not fool's gold, but I still pine for those deep, yellow nuggets...</p>
