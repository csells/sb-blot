<h1>Pragmatic ADO.NET in stock!</h1>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201745682/chrissells">Here</a>. Shawn Wildermuth's new book, Pragmatic ADO.NET: Data Access for the Internet World, is awailable now. Shawn's a long-time friend of mine and I wrote the forward to the book, so I'm hardly unbiased, but it rocks! Enjoy.
