<h1>Updated VS.NET Fun Facts</h1>
<a href="/12594">Here</a>. I know I don't organize things well for finding what's new in my list of VS.NET Fun Facts, but if you haven't checked back in a while, I add new tips and tricks all the time.

Today I added Nick Hodapp's tip on reducing the amount of time VC7 spends checking included header files for changes and another on Shawn Van Ness's "grokking" of the VS.NET clipboard ring.

If you have a fun fact, send it along!
