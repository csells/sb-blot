<h1>Ventura Not Seeking Re-Election</h1>
<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/670/2912980.html">Here</a>. As a former MN resident, I'm very happy to report that Jessie "The Body" Ventura will not be running for another term as governor. I didn't have anything against Mr. Ventura because he was a wrestler -- my issue is that he's an idiot. I was embarrassed for the state of my birth that he won and I'm happy that he won't be a choice in the future.
