<h1>SOAPScope Ships</h1>
<a href="http://www.mindreef.com/products/products.html">Here</a>. "Mindreef SOAPscope Personal is an easy-to-use, toolkit independent diagnostic aid for developers, testers and application support technicians who must isolate Web Services problems. Our primary design goal with SOAPscope Personal was to create the best logger/viewer for Web Services - one that is SOAP, WSDL and XML aware. Most Web Services developers and testers use some type of tracing tool to troubleshoot problems, but the available tools lack the features needed to make troubleshooting efficient. By combining a scaleable logging environment with many innovative features, Mindreef SOAPscope Personal easily meets our original goal."

MindReef showed the beta version at the Web Services DevCon to critical acclaim. It sure looks good.
