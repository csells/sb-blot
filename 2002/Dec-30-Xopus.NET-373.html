<h1>Xopus.NET</h1>
<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0117374/">Here</a>. From Jesse Ezell: "I have put together a Xopus wrapper for .NET. Basically, it isolates you from having to know all the Xopus details: just drag, drop, and set the designer properties."

Xopus is an opensource browser based WYSIWYG xml / xsl based editor that works natively in IE 5.5+ / Mozilla 1.3+ / Netscape 7+. Pretty cool stuff.
