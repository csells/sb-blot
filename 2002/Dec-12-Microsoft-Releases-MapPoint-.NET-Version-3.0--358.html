<h1>Microsoft Releases MapPoint .NET Version 3.0 </h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2002/Dec02/12-12MapPointNETv3PR.asp">Here</a>. I'm a big fan of both the MapPoint .NET web service specifically (it's a model in several areas) and of the idea of commercial web services in general. Someday I hope to be able to afford this one. : )
