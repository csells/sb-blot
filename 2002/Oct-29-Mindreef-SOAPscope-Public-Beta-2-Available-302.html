<h1>Mindreef SOAPscope Public Beta 2 Available</h1>
<a href="http://www.mindreef.com/beta2_application.php">Here</a>. "SOAPscope is designed to help diagnose problems developing XML Web Services by logging message traffic and helping you find problems with the SOAP messages and WSDL."

Mindreef did a very cool demo of their diagnostics tools at the DevCon and it was a big hit. Recommended.
