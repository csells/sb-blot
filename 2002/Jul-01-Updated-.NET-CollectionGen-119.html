<h1>Updated .NET CollectionGen</h1>
<a href="/12424">Here</a>. "CollectionGen is a Custom Tool Add-In to VS.NET to generate type-safe collections. The updates are as follows:

"-Finally someone has figured out the XSLT garbage bug! Thanks, Matthias Hess!

"-Removed the need for a .reg file, so now registration is just 'regasm /codebase collectionGen.dll'.

"Also, Jon Flanders put together a collection gen project item wizard that adds a new XML file with the Custom Tool property pre-set. I'm having a little trouble packaging it for distribution, but if anyone wants to hack on it, send me an email."
