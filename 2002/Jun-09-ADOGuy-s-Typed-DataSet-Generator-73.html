<h1>ADOGuy's Typed DataSet Generator</h1>
<p>"The Typed DataSet that Microsoft generates from Visual Studio.NET (or from the XSD.exe tool), does not support derivation directly. In order to allow us to derive from Typed DataSets, Chris Sells and I created <a href="http://adoguy.com/book/AGDataSetGenerator.aspx">this tool</a> that fixes the couple of issues with inheriting from Typed DataSets."</p>
