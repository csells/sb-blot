<h1>SafeFormatter for .NET</h1>
   <p align="left">Are you building and deploying .NET applications in a secure 
    environment, e.g. over the intranet or the internet? If so, they you've 
    probably mourned the loss of the binary and SOAP formatters that can 
    automatically serialize a graph of objects that are marked as [Serializable] 
    and that may also implement ISerializable and IDeserializationCallback. Both 
    of these formatters are dependent on reflection, which will not be available 
    in a more restrictive security environment. Likewise, even 
    ISerialization.GetObjectData is verboten if you wanted to do this kind of 
    thing yourself. As far as that goes, [Serializable] and ISerialization <i>
    should</i> be forbidden in a secure environment, as it allows a client to 
    get and set the private variables of an object, potentially causing harm.</p>
    <p align="left">Still, security is the enemy of usability, to paraphrase 
    Keith Brown. So, in the spirit of a balancing the design need for objects 
    that can serialize themselves with the goal of complete disclosure in a 
    secure world, I've built my own &quot;safe&quot; formatter. It only uses facilities of 
    the runtime that work in the most secure environment of the default settings 
    for the internet zone. So that objects can guard themselves against 
    malicious data, I define a new interface called ISafelySerializeable that 
    they need to implement to support this serialization facility. The protocol 
    is exactly the same as ISerializable, so if that interface is already being 
    implemented, the implementation of GetObjectData can be shared between both 
    interfaces.</p>
    <p align="left">Currently, the code is in alpha and is riddled with TODO 
    statements, but its functional enough today for actual usage.

    for your feedback.</a> Enjoy.</p></div>
