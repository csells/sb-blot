<h1>Gyro! Gyro!</h1>
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/clrgen/">Here</a>. From John Bristowe: Gyro is a set of files that convert an existing installation of the Microsoft Shared Source CLI to support generic type definitions and generic methods. Gyro extends the CLI, ILAsm assembler, and C# compiler. It also includes several samples, documentation (in the form of specifications) and some new tests. It does not support generics in the JScriptÂ® compiler.
