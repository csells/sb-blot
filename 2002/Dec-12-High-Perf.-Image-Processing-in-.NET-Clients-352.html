<h1>High Perf. Image Processing in .NET Clients</h1>
<a href="http://cedar.intel.com/cgi-bin/ids.dll/content/content.jsp?cntKey=Generic%20Editorial::dotnet_processing&cntType=IDS_EDITORIAL&catCode=BZW">Here</a>. "Not so many years ago, serious image processing meant using highly specialized hardware when same-day service was required. However, microprocessor manufacturers have consistently delivered exponential performance improvements for so long that even relatively modest client systems can now perform non-trivial image manipulation very quickly. These client capabilities were especially aided by the introduction of Streaming SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) Extensions to IntelÂ® processors a few years ago, along with Intel's highly-optimized libraries for exploiting the technology. This article shows how to take advantage of these libraries in .NET client applications."
