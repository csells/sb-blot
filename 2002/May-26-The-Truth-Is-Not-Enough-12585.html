<h1>The Truth Is Not Enough</h1>

        <p>Watching the final episode of the X-Files, I realized why I don't 
        like that show. Mulder spends all his time searching for the truth, but 
        even when he finds the date of the planned alien invasion, he doesn't do 
        anything with it! They've spent the last nine years discovering the 
        truth and not doing anything to change it (or, if they do try, they fail 
        miserably). Of course, that's not the only problem with the show (e.g. 
        why would an alien race powerful enough to do generic engineering to 
        produce the &quot;miracle child&quot; or to create &quot;super soldiers&quot; or to create 
        the virus in the first place, needs to bother with setting up a shadow 
        government), but it's the one that bothers me the most.</p>
        <p>Just knowing the 
        truth is not enough. You need to act on it.</p>
        <p>I don't really know what that's got to do with the price of tea in 
        China, but hey, you get what you pay for. : )</p>
