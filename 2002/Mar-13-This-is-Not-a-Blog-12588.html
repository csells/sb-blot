<h1>This is Not a Blog</h1>

        <p>Web Logging (blogging) is the wave of the future. Blogging is re-making the internet. 
        Blogging is journalism where everyone is the journalist. Blogging is all that and a 
        bag of donuts.</p>
        <p>OK. I guess so. I like blogs. I read a bunch of blogs. 
        But most bloggers feel like they have to update their site at least 
        once/day and most do it far more than that. Because of this, their blog 
        entries end up looking like this:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i>[burb]</i> Excuse me.</p>
          <p>[<a href="http://www.fakeurl.com">google this!</a>] [<a href="http://www.fakeurl.com">comment 
          on this! (0 comments so far)</a>]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's not that I don't love to read a daily blow-by-blow of these 
        peoples' lives... oh, wait, no, it is that. Maybe a little filtering 
        would be handy?</p>
        <p>And while we're on to the filtering thing, maybe we could drop the 
        meta-comments about blogging itself? How cool could blogging really be 
        if every other entry is about the power of blogging itself or, even 
        worse, a link to somebody who linked to your cool description of the 
        power of blogging?!?</p>
        <p>Anyway, the spout is not a blog. I only update it when I think I've 
        got something interesting to say (even if it's something that only I'm 
        likely to think is interesting), I don't use any content management 
        software (unless you count ASP.NET and FrontPage : ) 
        and, except for this entry, I don't spend any time talking about the 
        wonder of blogging itself.</p>
