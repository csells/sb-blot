<h1>Reaction from Microsoft</h1>
<span class="created">2/18/2002</span>
<p>&nbsp;Here's a quote from an anonymous source:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I was given your page address from a friend who happens to work at Microsoft and does interviews. He has told 
	me that Microsoft has told all its interviewing employees to keep an eye on your page for ideas and thoughts.&quot; </p></blockquote><p>Figures. I set out to help the <i>interviewees</i> and I end up helping the <i>interviewers.</i> Is there nothing that Microsoft can't leverage for their own benefit? </p>
