<h1>Sun joins Microsoft on Web services security</h1>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/770511.asp">Here</a>. "Sun Microsystems Inc. said Thursday it will join rivals Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. in developing a technical standard to make sure Web services transactions are secure."

As great as this announcement is, I have my doubts as to whether it will last. Sun and MS don't seem to like to play together.
