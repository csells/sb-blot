<h1>CollectionGen Updated</h1>
<a href="/12424">Here</a>. The CollectionGen hits, they keep on coming. Tor-Erik Hagen has split the core code from the VS.NET custom tool code to provide for the command line tool he also provided, along with porting all the C# template code to VB.NET. Justin Rudd and James Johnson have also contributed some efficiency and type-safety enhancements. If only we had a wizard, we'd be set (I've got the beginnings of one, if anyone is interested). Enjoy!
