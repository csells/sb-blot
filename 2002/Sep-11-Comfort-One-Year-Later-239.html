<h1>Comfort, One Year Later</h1>
<a href="/12601">Here</a>. A year ago, thousands of people lost their lives at the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon. I'm working from home, so I can't put on my headlights, but I've been doing a lot of thinking about that day today and my "virtual" headlights are most definitely on. I'm sure today is very difficult for the survivors and I'd like to extend whatever comfort I can. May God bless you all.
