<h1>Mastering Visual Studio .NET sample chapters</h1>
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mastvsnet/chapter/index.html">Here</a>. "Mastering Visual Studio .NET, by Jon Flanders and Chris Sells

"Most developers can perform the basics inside Visual Studio .NET, like creating a project, typing some code, compiling and debugging. Although Mastering Visual Studio .NET covers these topics, it does so very quickly. This book enables intermediate and advanced programmers the kind of depth that's really needed, such as advanced window functionality, macros, advanced debugging, and add-ins, etc. With this book, developers will learn the VS.NET development environment from top to bottom."
