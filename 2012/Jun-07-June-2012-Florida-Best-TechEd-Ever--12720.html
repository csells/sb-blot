<h1>June, 2012, Florida: Best TechEd Ever!</h1>
<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" align="right" src="http://northamerica.msteched.com/p/tena2011/resources/techEdHeaderLogo.jpg" />This month in Florida is going to be my 2nd TechEd ever and I’m sure the best by far. The number of things I get to do is staggering:</p>  <ul>   <li>I get to work the Telerik booth for my first big show. We’ll be launching not one but two completely new Telerik products. Fun!     <br /></li>    <li>Since <a href="http://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx">the Telerik Ultimate Collection</a> has been nominated for the Best of TechEd, I get to give a dead-run 15-minute demo to the judges with fellow Teleriker <a href="http://michaelcrump.net/">Michael Crump</a>.      <br /></li>    <li>Also with Michael, I’ll be giving the 30-minute &quot;Telerik + Blend: Better Together&quot; talk in the Microsoft Visual Studio booth showing off how 3rd party controls work inside the newest Blend for building Metro style apps on Windows 8.     <br /></li>    <li>The first chapter of <a href="/win8jsbook">the Metro/JS book</a> I’m writing with another fellow Teleriker <a href="http://www.userinexperience.com/">Brandon Statrom</a> is being printed and bound in a limited quantity for the show. Stop by and get your signed copy!      <br /></li>    <li>I get to be one of the Speaker Idol judges every day at lunch.     <br /></li>    <li>I’m sure there’s at least one podcast recording in there, too, somewhere…</li> </ul>  <p>I honestly can’t remember when I’ve looked forward to a conference more. I’ll see you there!</p>
