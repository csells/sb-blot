<h1>Free Portland Code Camp, 7/22-23</h1>
<P>I've just registered for <A href="http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/2/default.aspx">the Portland Code Camp 2.0, July 22-23</A>. It's a free conference that includes <A href="http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/2/sessions.aspx">26 developer sessions</A> (so far), food, a party and the potential to win an XBox 360. And did I mention it was free? I'm not sure about the name (it's being held at <A href="http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/2/travel.aspx">the Washington State University in Vancouver, WA</A>), but other than that, what's not to love about a local, free, developer conference?!?</P>
<P>And if you're coming from out of town and need a place to crash, I've got a spare room. Come one, come all! Tell a friend! <A href="http://pdx.techevents.info/codecamp/2/register.aspx">Register today!</A> It's free!</P>
