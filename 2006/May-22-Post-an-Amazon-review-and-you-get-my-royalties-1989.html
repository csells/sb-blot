<h1>Post an Amazon review and you get my royalties</h1>
<p><i>Update: Whoops -- didn't think of the ways to abuse this system. I've updated the offer <a href="/1991">here</a>.</i></p>
<P>If you <A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321267966/">post a legitimate review on Amazon for Windows Forms 2.0 Programming</A> before the 4th of July, 2006, I will personally send you my royalties for that copy of the book ($4.77 -- don't spend it all in one place : ).</P>
<P>You have to put your email into the Amazon review so that I can communicate with you about your address and Sells Brothers, Inc. can send you a check, but <EM><STRONG>good review or bad</STRONG></EM>, my royalties for one copy of the book are yours.</P>
<P>The first five reviewers also get signed copies shipped to their home (I'll get Mike to sign it, too). Again, the email needs to be in the post.</P>
