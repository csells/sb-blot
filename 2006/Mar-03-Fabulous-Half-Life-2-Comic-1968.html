<h1>Fabulous Half-Life 2 Comic</h1>
<P>Here's a tip -- if you've got a deadline, don't wander over to <A href="http://www.hlcomic.com/">the Half-Life 2 comic "Concerned."</A>&nbsp;I'm a *huge* Half-Life and Half-Life 2 fan, so when I heard about it, I went right over and now that's two hours of my life I'll never get back (but were oh so pleasantly spent) reading all 120 comic strips front to back. Since I've been spending my evenings and weekends playing Half-Life 2 again (why oh why aren't there any more good games?!?), all of the stuff in these comics is fresh in my mind. Plus, I don't mean "comic inspired by Half-Life 2;" the guy actually posing characters and objects from the game using a Half-Life 2 mod and builds his comics out of the screen shots, adding hilarious&nbsp;prose. It's like if <A href="http://www.neopoleon.com/">Rory</A>&nbsp;built his comics from "Stick Figure World 3D" (coming soon to XBox&nbsp;360).&nbsp;Very highly recommended.</P>
