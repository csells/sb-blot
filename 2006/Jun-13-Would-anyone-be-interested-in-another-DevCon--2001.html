<h1>Would anyone be interested in another DevCon?</h1>
<P>I'm thinking about doing a DevCon before the end of the year (likely October) in a pleasant environment (likely <A href="http://www.skamania.com/">the Skamania Lodge</A>) on a topic that's *not* XML or Web Services based (we've done that topic to death). The soul of the DevCon will remain the same, i.e. to cut away all the unessential conference baggage and concentrate on why we're spending time at a conference in the first place -- the talks by industry experts and experienced practitioners.</P>
<P>If I organized such an event, would anyone come?</P>
