<h1>Phones are just little PCs and should be treated as such</h1>
<P>Folks are having enough issues with their <A href="/2005">Qtek 8500 phones</A> that they're starting to want to trade them in on <A href="http://www.imate.com/t-DETAILS_SMARTFLIP.aspx">IMate Smartphones</A>, which are the same HTC hardware but different software. Issues include (for me):</P>
<UL>
<LI>phone not ringing on all incoming phone calls</LI>
<LI>phone not providing notification of pending voicemail</LI>
<LI>heavy bluetooth interference</LI>
<LI>fuzzy pictures</LI></UL>
<P>Yesterday, I used <A href="http://www.howardforums.com/showpost.php?p=7591115&amp;postcount=551">Stork's instructions</A> to turn my Qtek into a Smartflip and have not had any of the problems except for the bluetooth interference.</P>
<P>The real problem is that, unlike with PCs, phone hardware manufacturers don't actually support their phones. If I buy a Dell, they'll provide BIOS and driver upgrades. If I buy an Qtek, they send me to the cell provider for a fix who, of course, doesn't have the Qtek 8500 on their list.</P>
<P>With the flexibility of phones these days, they're just like pocket-sized PCs and there's a lot more innovation going on with them then with my PC right now. I used to get excited about my new laptop; now I get excited about my new phone. However, this situation about who you're supposed to buy phones from and get support from is completely messed up and needs to change.</P>
