<h1>Hello from ASP.NET 2.0</h1>
I ported sellsbrothers.com to ASP.NET 2.0 a while ago, but I wasn't happy with the experience, so I didn't pull the trigger on moving it to a production environment. I'm glad I waited. I ported the site again last night using the <A href="http://webproject.scottgu.com/">VS05 Web Application Project preview</A> and it worked a treat. Recommended.
