<h1>Fun Presentation</h1>
In massive writing avoidance mode, I found my way to Seth Godin (who I don't know from Adam) doing <A href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4101280286098310645&amp;hl=en">a great presentation on stuff that's broken</A> at Gel 2006 (I conference I've never heard of) as a way to promote <A href="http://www.thisisbroken.com/">his site</A>. I found the presentation itself at <A href="http://www.presentationzen.com/">Presentation Zen</A>, when I read about in Guy Kawasi's essay on <A href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html">The 10/20/30 Rule of PowerPoint</A>, which I found on the sidebar of <A href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/08/startup_success.html">the Startup Success 2006</A>, which I got to from <A href="http://www.churchillclub.org/">the Churchill Club web site</A>.<EM>&nbsp;</EM>I can't for the life of me remember how I got to the Churchill Club web site, but it killed a lot of time (did I mention I was in writing&nbsp;avoidance mode?).
