<h1>A C# Bedtime Story Updated for C# 2.0</h1>
<P>Seeing a reference to <a href="/public/writing/delegates.htm">A C# Bedtime Story</A> as a generic definition for .NET delegates in a recent DDJ article inspired me to post <a href="/public/writing/delegates.htm">the new and improved version</A> that takes into account C# 2.0's anonymous delegate support. Enjoy.</P>
