<h1>Greetings from Switzerland</h1>
<P>Hello from the fabulous Victoria-Jungrau Hotel in Interlaken, Switzerland, where Mel and I have just landed after three days in a much dinkier hotel in Rome (and although it was just a block away from the Vatican, I never ran into the pope at any of the local eateries or pubs...). I tried to post from the coin-operated Unix machine in our hotel basement last night, but the browser didn't like the POST involved in adding new content to my site (or maybe it was the alt-shift-left knee to get the @ sign to appear on the Italian keyboard...).</P>
<P>This hotel room is nicer than our house, as evidenced by the fact that Mel made me take my jacket off the bed so that she could get &#8220;pristine&#8221; shots (including from an elevated position in the bathroom). They always treat us so well in Switzerland. Highly recommended.</P>
<P>This is my first real connected experience since boarding the plane Sunday morning (I don't care how cool Outlook Web Access is&nbsp;-- it ain't nearly so cool as the Windows version), although I was able to get my cell phone to download my emails. I can't image what that bill will be like...</P>
