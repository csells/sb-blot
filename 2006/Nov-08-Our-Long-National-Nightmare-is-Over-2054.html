<h1>Our Long National Nightmare is Over</h1>
<P>Since at least 2001 we've been stuck in a quagmire of missteps, indecision, corruption and the eroding of our freedoms. Some of us feared it would never end.</P>
<P>But the US House and Senate are now officially out of the hands of the Republicans, and that's cause for much rejoicing. Let the balloons drop and the dancing begin! It's a new age.</P>
<P>P.S. apologies to Mr. Petzold for ripping off <A href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/11/080248.html">his blog post</A>, but when I saw it in <A href="http://live.com">my RSS reader</A>, I thought that the above would be the subject of his latest essay and that we would finally have something on which to agree. It'll be my luck that he's a staunch Republican and I'll hear about my misguideness tomorrow... : )</P>
