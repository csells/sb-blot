<h1>I'm *loving* the new live.com images search</h1>
<P><A href="http://live.com">Live.com</A> has a new image search which does progressive showing of images, scaling of the group and individual photos in very cool ways, but the killer feature is when you surf to the page from whence the image comes, the image is shown in full size hovering above the page. Very slick. My only complaint is that there seems to be no way to do an image search w/o first doing a normal search and then pressing the "Images" button. Still, I've switched from a9.com and google.com image search.</P>
