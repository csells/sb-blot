<h1>Laura Foy makes on10.net for me</h1>
<P>I had my first <A href="http://www.on10.net/about.aspx">on 10</A> experience today (I was following the links to the PhotoSynth stuff) and I have to say, I instantly fell in love with <A href="http://www.on10.net/people/Laura/">Laura Foy</A>. I know that Erica Wiechers (of <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/">The .NET Show</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/">MSDN TV</A>) has a huge geekboy fan base (and it was fun to work with her @ MSDN), but Laura's interviewing style&nbsp;and her personality made me subscribe to <A href="http://www.on10.net/people/Laura/rss/">her interviewer-specific RSS feed</A> on 10.</P>
<P>In fact, Laura makes me wish I did something besides developer-related stuff. What do I have to do to be interviewed by Laura Foy?!?</P>
<P>P.S. I wanted to title this blog entry "Laura Foy is a major babe," but Laura is a fellow Microsoft employee and that would be inappropriate. Also, the whistling and cat calls would be way out...</P>
