<h1>My Qtek 8500 should be in my hands tomorrow!</h1>
<P>The reviews <A href="http://lifeofaprogrammanager.blogspot.com/2006/06/dopod-s300-qtek-8500-mini-review.html">have</A> <A href="http://www.theunwired.net/?itemid=3043">been</A> <A href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2006Apr/rev20060410035742.htm">largely</A> <A href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2006/05/09/qtek-8500-htc-strtrk-review-by-theunwired/">positive</A>&nbsp;(but not <A href="http://www.cellphonenews.net/archives/2006/06/qtek_8500_windows_mobile_5_smartphone_review.php">completely</A>), and I'm very much looking forward to my new <A href="http://www.mobileplanet.com/product.asp?code=133791">QTEK 8500</A> (aka the Star Trek [STRTrk?]). Apparently I'll be one of the first folks on the west coast to have it, which will probably destroy my book-writing productively over the weekend (I'm supposed to be working on the Avalon RTM book).</P>
<P>Being first with hardware is not generally something I like to do. In general, I purchase laptops and cell phones and not many of either (usually one every 18 months of either). Frankly, I'm a late adopter on&nbsp;hardware 'cuz I like to handle someone else's&nbsp;first (no snide comments, please... : ).&nbsp;However, the experience with my Audiovox 5600 has been so positive and the features of the QTEK 8500 are so overwhelming (on paper) that I just had to get it ASAP. It's really the first Windows Mobile 5 phone I've found compelling.</P>
<P>Stay tuned for a review.</P>
