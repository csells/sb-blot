<h1>Xbox 360 Warranty: Now 1 Year (Retroactively!)</h1>
<P>I love it when we do <A href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2006/1222-xbox360warrantyextended.htm">a good thing</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Effective today (December 22), the one year warranty is now the standard for all Xbox 360 consoles. Customers that experience hardware issues with their Xbox 360 within one year of purchase will have their consoles repaired at no cost. Moreover, the new warranty policy is retroactive, so consumers that may have already paid for out-of-warranty Xbox 360 repair within one year of the console's purchase will be eligible for reimbursement of their console repair charges."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'm a big Vista fan, I'm loving Office 12 and I live on my WM5 phone, but the Xbox 360 is currently the coolest thing we do. And it just keeps getting better.</P>
<P>P.S. If the postscripts aren't appreciated, why do they get all the feedback?</P>
