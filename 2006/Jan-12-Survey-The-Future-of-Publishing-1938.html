<h1>Survey: The Future of Publishing</h1>
<P>Karen Gettman, my editor at Addison-Wesley, called and asked me a bunch of questions about the future of publishing yesterday. After our discussion, she asked if I knew anyone else and I volunteered to put a survey up on my web site.</P>
<P>To answer this survey, send the questions below and your answers to <A href="mailto:Karen.Gettman@AWL.com">Karen.Gettman@AWL.com</A>. Also, include your phone number so Karen can call to follow up (she finds the phone conversations to be most illuminating when it comes to really figuring out how people want to get to info -- we spent a bunch of time talking about hardware and software for ebooks). Thanks from Karen for your help!</P>
