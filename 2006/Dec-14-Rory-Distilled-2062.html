<h1>Rory, Distilled</h1>
<P>Lord knows, I love <A href="http://neopoleon.com/">Rory</A>, but easily my favorite thing are <A href="http://neopoleon.com/home/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=comic">his comics</A>.&nbsp;However, he doesn't do enough of them, so if you're looking for a Rory-alternative between comics, check out <A href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</A>. This is the one that made me realize just how Rory xkcd is:</P>

<P>I wonder how often this happens to Rory? : )</P>
<p>P.S. I look forward to the day when it's just as easy to get int'l news in the US as corporate-spun news. The world will be a better place when we realize that we're not the only ones on the planet.</p>
