<h1>XAML Design Tools from Microsoft</h1>
<P>If you're a designer looking for XAML design tools, and you're a designer type (you know -- beret, turtle neck, a wardrobe that extends beyond jeans and t-shirts), you've got two choices from Microsoft. You can use <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/expression-design/default.mspx">Expression Design</A> [1] for static XAML graphics or <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/expression-blend/default.mspx">Expression Blend</A> (aka Sparkle) for dynamic XAML interfaces. Both are available in pre-release form (<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/expression-design/free-trial.mspx">CTP for Design</A> and <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/Expression-Blend/try.mspx">Beta 1 for Blend</A>), so give them a try.</P>
<P>[1] "Expression Design" is not to be confused with "Expression Design<STRONG><EM>er</EM></STRONG>", which is the old name for Sparkle (Blend).</P>
<P>P.S. Can someone give Scoble a hug? He's obviously a little worked up if he's <A href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/26/calling-chris-sells-i-hate-blogs-that-dont-work-with-google-reader/">recommending physical violence for disagreements about web site design</A>. : )</P>
