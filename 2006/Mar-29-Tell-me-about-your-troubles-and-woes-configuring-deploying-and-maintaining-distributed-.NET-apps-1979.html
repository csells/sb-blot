<h1>Tell me about your troubles and woes configuring, deploying and maintaining distributed .NET apps</h1>
<P>Believe it or not, Microsoft is always trying to improve its products and to do so, I find we do our best work when we actually ask our potential customers what they think.</P>
<P>In this case, I&#8217;d like to know <STRONG>what &#8220;pain points&#8221; you experience when configuring, deploying and maintaining distributed .NET applications</STRONG>. That can be any kind of app, whether it&#8217;s a client-side app that phones home for code or data updates or whether it&#8217;s a fully distributed grid or anything in between. Please be as specific as possible and, if you&#8217;d like one of our courteous technical people to follow-up, make sure to include contact info.</P>
<P>Use this as an opportunity to vent &#8211; don&#8217;t hold back. Remember: the life you save may be your own&#8230;</P>
