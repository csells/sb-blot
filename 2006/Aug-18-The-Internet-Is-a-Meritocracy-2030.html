<P>It's easy to think that if you're already got a high page rank in google, that you'll get more than your far share of traffic, polarizing the internet into a small number of sites that get all the hits. Luckily, according to "<A href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0605525103v1">Topical interests and the mitigation of search engine bias</A>," published in <A href="http://www.pnas.org/">the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</A>, that's not the case:</P>
