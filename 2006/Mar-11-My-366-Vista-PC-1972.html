<h1>My $366 Vista PC</h1>
<P>This morning, I read about <A href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1932801,00.asp">a $159 computer from a review on the PC Magazine site</A>:</P>
<P><IMG src="/public/spout/gq3131.jpg"></P>
<P>I called my local&nbsp;<A href="http://www.frys.com/">Fry's</A>, and while they were no longer have the $159 sale (apparently "quantities are limited"), they would be willing to sell me one for $171. While I was there, I got a 1GB memory upgrade and a 256MB ATI graphics card. Here's the equipment I went home with:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fry's Genuine Quality 3131 PC: <STRONG>$170.99</STRONG></LI>
<UL>
<LI>1.67GHz CPU</LI>
<LI>128MB of RAM</LI>
<LI>40GB HD</LI>
<LI>10/100 integrated Ethernet</LI>
<LI>56KB modem card</LI>
<LI>52X CD-ROM</LI>
<LI>Stereo speakers</LI>
<LI>Keyboard + Mouse (including roller ball)</LI></UL>
<LI>ATI Radeon 9550, AGP 8x/4x, 256MB DDR RAM: <STRONG>$94.99</STRONG></LI>
<LI>1GB RAM SIMM(for a total of 1.1GB of RAM): <STRONG>$99.99</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>I then added an LCD panel and a DVD drive I had laying around. <STRONG>Total cost $365.97.</STRONG></P>
<P>When I got the PC, it came pre-installed with Lindows, the Linux distro meant to look and act like Windows. And I gotta say, it wasn't too bad. Then, because they ship a free CD that runs directly w/o an install, I plugged in Ubuntu, another popular client-side Linux distro which was also surprisingly easy to use. Neither was as familiar as Windows XP, of course, but they were both a lot easier to use then the last time I ran Linux.</P>
<P>At 12:04am, I started the Vista Feb '06 CTP installation. At 12:44am, I was running Vista, it having recognized all of hardware (except the sound device) from my $366 PC, including enabling those cool "glass" effects and the nifty animations, integrated search and all the neat things you've read about in the Vista reviews.</P>
<P>I know I work for "the man," but even so, I'm seriously impressed. The install was fast and seamless. The performance is way better than I thought it would be. And the little UI tricks are fabulous. I can't do any media stuff 'cuz my audio device wasn't recognized, but it was cool when I tried to play video and a DVD, that the Vista Media Center UI came up (my complete home entertainment needs are served with a coupla TVs, a Media Center PC and an XBox).</P>
<P>I know, I know, I got the OS for free, but come on! It's still beta and it runs great on my cheapo PC! I don't know what Vista's going to go for, but I bet the whole she-bang (including LCD panel and DVD drive) could be had for ~$500 when Vista ships. Plus,&nbsp;I've only been playing with it for about an hour, but I already don't want to go back to my XP boxes...</P>
<P>P.S. This post was composed and posted from "visto," my new Vista PC.</P>
