<h1>I listen to one podcast: HanselMinutes</h1>
<P>Scott created his podcast with the idea of not wasting his listeners' time and he's done it. <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">HanselMinutes</A> is the only podcast I listen to. In fact, I prepared for&nbsp;a long car drive by filling my phone w/ episodes I hadn't hear yet and listened all the way (except when I called Scott to complain about one of them : ).</P>
<P>Not only does Scott have a fabulous list of topics for the Windows developer, but the way he explains them is wonderful, too. I don't know where the guy finds the time to do all the stuff he talks about; I'm jealous!</P>
<P>In fact, I'm so enamored of his show, I've been trying to horn my way onto an episode (and not just 'cuz <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=34">he had very nice things to say about me recently</A> [19:53&nbsp;- 21:12]). I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but either way, if you only listen to one podcaster this year, it should be <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Scott</A>.</P>
