<h1>Dammit!</h1>
<P>There are a very few games I could call "great." Doom (of course). Half-Life 2. Burnout Revenge. Mario Kart. And last week, I added another game: Gears of War. Wow. I'm almost exclusively a first-person-shooter person (although I never liked the Halo series), but GoW has converted me to 3rd person. It rocks.</P>
<P>The one flaw in GoW is that it's too damn short! I've already finished&nbsp;the entire game&nbsp;on "casual," so now it's time to start over again on "hardcore" and begin the n-year wait for GoW 2. &lt;sigh&gt;</P>
<P>P.S. I believe in God, but am not a member of any religion. I was confirmed Catholic, but am no longer one.</P>
