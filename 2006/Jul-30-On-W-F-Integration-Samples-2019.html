<h1>On W*F Integration Samples</h1>
<P>As you may or may not recall, <a href="/12467">Doug Purdy and I had some trouble at the last PDC</A> getting Avalon (WPF) and Indigo (WCF) to work together. To save myself from having that trouble again, I came back from the PDC and starting the "WinFX Cross-Pillar SDK Samples Working Group," which is just a fancy name for the PMs in charge of Avalon, Indigo and Workflow samples getting together to make sure that we have a list of simple technology samples showing the three W*F technologies working together.</P>
<P>You can see the results of that work in the .NET 3.0 SDK under the <A href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms756478.aspx">Integration Samples for WinFX Features</A> topic. Right now, there are 9 integration samples and I'm hoping to almost double that by .NET 3.0 RTM. I'd love feedback. Thanks!</P>
