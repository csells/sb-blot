<h1>Vista Song Parody from Ted + Carl!</h1>
I'm a big Ted Pattison fan in general (you have *got* to hear the story where the cowboy shows up at the door in buttless leather chaps), but he's at his best when he's singing (or holding Don's hand). Of course, Carl Franklin's no slouch at singing either (I don't know how he his at holding hands or whether his chaps have a butt or not), so <A href="http://www.pwop.com/vista.mp3">you'll want to hear them singing "Why Did Shipping Vista Turn Out to be so Hard"</A> sttto "Me and Julio Down by the School Yard," by Paul Simon. Enjoy.
