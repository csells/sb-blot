<h1>I want a service that "rips" books</h1>
<P>Assuming <A href="http://products.sel.sony.com/pa/PRS/">the Sony Reader</A> is cool, I still won't have all the content I want and I certainly don't want to repurchase all of my books. In the same way copyright law enables me to backup my CDs and DVDs, I want to "rip" my books and comics for electronic use. I'd like the same technology that the Google and the Amazon folks are using to digitize existing books (the folks that litter USENIX with copyright materials must have a cool setup, too). My understanding is that, unlike CDs and DVDs, which are easy to read via computer, books are not, so I'll need a service where I can box up my books and send 'em for ripping, resulting in a shiny DVD filled with my words and images, ideally OCR'd enough to allow full text search. In fact, after a while, the book rip houses would have most books on file, so I'd only have to prove that I own a book and they could email me the electronic version, saving us both the shipping charges. In further fact, this is an additional service that Google and/or Amazon could provide, since they're already "ripping" the books they sell...</P>
