<h1>When to ship a book is hard to know these days...</h1>
<P>Mr. Petzold beat me to the punch on the Windows Forms 2.0 book and he's going to do it again on the RTM Avalon book. However, such a thing is dicey, as <A href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/06/271246.html">Mr. Petzold points out</A>.</P>
<P>It was in researching the Windows Forms 1.0 book when I grew to be scared of finalizing a book before the technology was finalized; that's when they added AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute and it screwed up the entire No-Touch Deployment story. Toward that end, we didn't ship the WinForms 2.0 book 'til after the .NET 2.0 bits went gold and we won't ship the paper copy of the Avalon 1.0 book 'til then, either (although I understand ORA is going to be shipping early electronic drafts of our work as we do it). I have to sacrifice 2-3 months on the shelves to my competitors, but I get to be less scared of big, last minute changes.</P>
<P>It's a judgment call, though. In this era of books with 12-18 month shelf lives, I can't say Mr. Petzold's not right...</P>
