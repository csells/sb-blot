<h1>The "Famous" Book Fight</h1>
<P>So, I read <A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/17092.aspx">Rory's latest comic</A> and laughed. A lot. However, I haven't posted it because I figured anyone who'd be amused would've already seen it.</P>
<P>And then I got a ping from a marketing friend of mine who'd seen it and wondered what I thought. Granted, he's a marketing guy in the IT field, but still -- he's a *marketing* guy. I mean, I don't read their bait &amp; switch blogs, so what's he doing reading our geek-out blogs?!?</P>
<P>Rory, dude, I expect to see you in Time magazine one day. Don't forget the little people (even if they need help carrying their ego : ).</P>
