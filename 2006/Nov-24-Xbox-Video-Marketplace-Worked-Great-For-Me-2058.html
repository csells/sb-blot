<h1>Xbox Video Marketplace Worked Great For Me</h1>
<P>I tried the <A href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/moviestv/default.htm">Xbox Video Marketplace</A> on my 360 today. For 160 points ($2), I was able to purchase the season 2 premiere of&nbsp;Venture Bros (which is hilarious, btw) and 17% into the download, I was able to start watching it commercial free. Quality was high and I'm downloading Star Trek: The Enemy Within (a transporter accident creates an evil Kirk) for another $2 as I write this. The next experiment is a movie, but I'll wait for the wife to come home before we decide which one to pick.</P>
<P>The experience was seamless. Recommended.</P>
<P>P.S. I think gays and lesbians have just as much right to get married and to be parents as heterosexuals.</P>
