<h1>I'm with Scott -- I Love Monad</h1>
<P>I fell in love w/ the potential of monad a while ago w/ <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=25543">Jeffrey Snover's original Channel9 video</A>, but I was too lazy to download it onto all of my machines. However, after seeing Jeffrey's talk at <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/switzerland/techdays/de/default.mspx">TechDays 2006</A> in Switzerland (and remembering that monad is installed by default w/ the WinFX SDK, so it was already on all my machines), I took the dive (starting with <A href="http://www.answers.com/topic/kipe">kiping</A> Jeffrey's personal copy of <A href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/msh/index.html">"Monad," from ORA, Andy Oakley's most excellent monad intro</A>) and I've been doing it pretty much non-stop on the train and on the plane all the way home. Like <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LovingMushIMeanMonad.aspx">Scott,</a> I'm loving it.</P>
<P>I've built several scripts, including start-process (to act like cmd.exe's "start" command -- invoke-item doesn't work on URLs), find-file, find-filebytext, find-dir and format-notepad. So far, no luck on format-clipboard, i.e. dropping the results of an operation into the clipboard, but I'm having a blast trying.</P>
<P>Monad is the command line I've missed so much from my ex-life under Unix. <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/hubs/msh.mspx">Give it a try!</A> You'll love it.</P>
