<h1>Teaching Kids To Do Cool Computer Stuff?</h1>
<P>My youngest son's teacher found out I work at MS, so now he expects me to come into his class to teach them cool stuff. I'm happy to do that, but now I'm worried about putting together a cool 1-4 hours of stuff to do, e.g.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cool PowerPoint stuff (wowing their classmates)</LI>
<LI>Cool Excel stuff (doing their math homework)</LI>
<LI>Cool Web stuff (building their own web site)</LI>
<LI>Cool Programming stuff (writing their own PC/XBox 360 games)</LI>
<LI>Cool Hardware stuff (programming a robot)</LI></UL>
<P>Obviously, I'm not the first person to want to teach kids how to do cool stuff w/ their computers. Can someone point me at some activities for a classroom for of kids to do in these (or other) categories? Thanks!</P>
<p>P.S. My son is a 6th grader, making his class 11 and 12 year olds.</p>
