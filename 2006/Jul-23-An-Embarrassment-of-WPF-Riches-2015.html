<h1>An Embarrassment of WPF Riches</h1>
<P>I just realized that Avalon is getting a book treatment unlike any other topic in my memory:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="http://www.simplegeek.com/categoryview.aspx/Programming%20Avalon">"Essential WPF,"</A> by Chris Anderson, architect on the MS WPF team</LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/wpf/index.html">"Applications = Code + Markup,"</A> by *the* Charles Petzold</LI>
<LI><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adam_nathan/archive/2006/05/17/599301.aspx">"WPF Unleashed,"</A> by Adam Nathan of ".NET and COM: The Complete Interoperability Guide," *the* book on .NET interop and the correspondingly wonderful <A href="http://pinvoke.net/">pinvoke.net</A>.</LI>
<LI><A href="/wpfbook">"Programming WPF,"</A> by Ian Griffiths and Chris Sells. Ian's depth of knowledge of graphics -- down to the hardware -- continues to amaze me.</LI></UL>
<P>User and GDI had Petzold. Win32 had Rector. MFC had Prosise. COM had Box. Indigo's got no big names I've yet seen, but Avalon gets Anderson, Petzold, Nathan *and* Griffiths?!? It's going to be a bloodbath in the market, but the readers are going to benefit. Why couldn't I have picked a lightweight topic, like, oh, I don't know, ASP.NET 2.0? : )</P>
