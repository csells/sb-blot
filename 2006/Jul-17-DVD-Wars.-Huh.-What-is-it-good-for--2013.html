<h1>DVD Wars. Huh. What is it good for?</h1>
Here&#8217;s the thing I don&#8217;t get about the next-gen "<A href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2005/tc20051020_154892.htm">DVD Wars</A>." When I moved from VHS to DVD, I got much higher quality output and random access to content. Given that DVDs are already letterbox, what do I get moving to an HD DVD format? Is the quality that much better? Are there other features I get that I&#8217;m going to really want? The only feature I wish I had was the ability to easily burn the main content of my DVDs to my computer for random access like I get w/ music today. Will the next-gen formats support that?
