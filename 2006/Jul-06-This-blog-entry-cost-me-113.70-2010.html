<h1>This blog entry cost me $113.70</h1>
<P>So, I'm loving my t-mobile cell phone account (I get unlimited HotSpot access at Starbucks and lots of other places, too). However, I just learned that one service I <EM>don't </EM>have is free text messaging. Normally, that's not a problem because I'm a middle-aged white guy and "texting" is for young kids cheating on tests and looking for sex partners (at least, that's what I get from the news : ).</P>
<P>Anyway, I just got my t-mobile bill and my phone has been receiving text messages to the tune of 54/day for a total of 1137 in the first 21 days. At $0.10/message, that doubled my bill and confused the hell out of me, because I only ever see a text message on my phone when I miss a call from my wife or when my European friends text me, i.e. about 10/month. Where have all of these text messages come from?</P>
<P>Apparently, they come from Exchange using AUTD (Always Up To Date) to notify my phone that new messages are available. I didn't know that's how this worked; I was just happy to get it to work at all. Luckily, this is no longer a problem. AUTD was apparently a Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition thing that my old Audiovox 5600 used (I must have had free text messaging on my AT&amp;T Wireless account and not noticed how young and hip my phone was).</P>
<P>Luckily, my text message traffic has fallen back to near zero because of my <A href="/2005">Qtek 8500</A>, which uses <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonlan/archive/2005/08/22/454717.aspx">"push email."</A> Apparently push email keeps an HTTP session open to Exchange using my unlimited data access instead of using my (very!) limited text message access.</P>
<P>I sure wish there'd been some way of knowing this before the first bill arrived, of course, but it's nice to know my Qtek is actually <EM>saving</EM> me money (at least, that's what I'll tell the wife : ).</P>
