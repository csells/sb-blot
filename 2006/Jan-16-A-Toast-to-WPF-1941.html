<P><EM>"Your WPF book is excellent. So good that I actually chose to read it instead of watching in flight entertainment from my trip to London in Dec... I liked it so much that I asked for some champaign, and continued to read it non-stop till I reached London from UK. Here&#8217;s a photo. Good job!"</EM></P><EM><IMG src="/public/writing/wpfbook/atoasttowpf.jpg"> </EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
