<h1>I'm really digging live.com</h1>
<P>I've tried all the portal sites at one time or another (yahoo, google, etc), but none of them have ever stuck 'til now. Since I gave up on subscribing to blogs, I find myself surfing to two sites every day: <A href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot.org</A> and <A href="http://live.com">live.com</A>. I like getting the news headlines and I really like <A href="http://microsoftgadgets.com/Gallery/">the gadgets</A>&nbsp;(not one, but *two* versions of 
<a href="/12661">Wahoo!</a> [both of which end in "tris" for some reason...]).</P>
<P>It's not perfect (the menu on the left obscures some text, there's no auto scrolling while you drag and it doesn't seem to like my smart phone), but it's definitely "sticky," at least for me.</P>
