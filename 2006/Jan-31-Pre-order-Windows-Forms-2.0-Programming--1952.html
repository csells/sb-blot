<h1>Pre-order "Windows Forms 2.0 Programming"</h1>
I just noticed that <A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321267966/">"Windows Forms 2.0 Programming,"</A> by Michael Weinhardt and Chris Sells, is available for pre-order. I've had a lot of requests for info on this book, so now folks can watch this space. Mike and I have finished the copy edit rounds, but we still haven't seen the final PDFs, so it's still going to be awhile (hopefully no later than early April).
