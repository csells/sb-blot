<h1>Imperative vs. Declarative</h1>
<P><A href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/">Savas</A> showed me this great example from a book he's reading. Consider this:</P>
<P>F = m * v</P>
<P>Using an imperative interpretation, this is a expression that, when evaluated, multiplies m and v, putting the result into F.</P>
<P>Using a declarative interpretation, this is an equation and is completely equivalent to the following:</P>
<P>m = F / v</P>
<P>The imperative interpretation allows me to execute. The declarative interpretation allows execution as well as addition reasoning.</P>
