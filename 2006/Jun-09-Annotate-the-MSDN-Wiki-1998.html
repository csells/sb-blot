<h1>Annotate the MSDN Wiki</h1>
For a long time, my favorite place to put up code snippets that I could get back to later has been <A href="http://www.pinvoke.net/">pinvoke.net</A> (like <A href="http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/kernel32/GetTempFileName.html">GetTempFileName</A>). However, that was only good for managed/native interop, whereas <A href="http://msdnwiki.microsoft.com/en-us/mtpswiki/default.aspx">the MSDN Wiki</A> is for anything in the docs. I don't know what their commitment is to keeping content over time or between versions, but I've got my fingers crossed. Enjoy!
