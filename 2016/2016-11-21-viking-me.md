# Viking Me

Today, I was asked about the story behind my viking avatar: The avatar is years and years old. Peter Stern, a graphic designer friend of mine, put together a set of avatars for me for something (I forget what) and the viking is the one that resonated with me the most because of my Norwegian heritage, my physical stature and my general demeanor (those of you who know me have never asked why I choose a Viking avatar : ).

However, it was my mention of a real-life picture of me in a viking helmet that lead to the challenge -- post that picture! So here you go. Enjoy. : )
