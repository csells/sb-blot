# It's Time To Fund Critical Flutter OSS Projects

As we round the corner of ten years of Flutter development from inception through three major versions, the Flutter project has moved from "scrappy startup" to "mature framework." Flutter is often cited as the #1 cross-platform solution for mobile apps just about as much as it's cited as next on the chopping block by Google (only one of those facts is true : ). The core framework as managed by the Dart and Flutter teams at Google is a big part of that. Equally important, if not more is, is the package ecosystem on https://pub.dev.

When Flutter 1.0 shipped in December of 2018, I remember there being about 1500 packages on pub.dev. A "package" (some of which are "plugins" that make use of native technology) is a reusable chunk of Dart code that you can use to build Flutter apps (and often to build lower-level Dart CLI or server apps as well, depending on the needs of the package). The last I checked, the package ecosystem had grown by 40x in the last 7 years. What this means practically, is that when you're building your Flutter app, chances are that you're going to have multiple choices when you're looking to fill a gap in your project with existing code. And because pub.dev does a good job at measuring and exposing quality metrics like scoring for things like docs coverage, compliance with best practices, sentiment ratings and download count, you have a reasonable chance at picking something that is going to work well for you, once you crunch the numbers.

## Flutter Favorites

One metric used on pub.dev that helps people the best choice is called [Flutter Favorite](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/favorites). The Flutter Favorite designation comes from the committee of Google employees and community experts to crunch the quality metrics for you along with a bunch of others that matter from a longer term usage point of view, like responsiveness to issues and PRs. It was invented to provide a quick glance way to help people determine quality when they're searching through their list of choices. It was also invented to give recognition to developers building high quality packages that really serve the Dart and Flutter community.

And it did that. From the time that the FF program was invented until I stopped having access to internal Google metrics, not only was the number of packages on pub.dev continuing to grow, but so was the average quality. These are not metrics that typically go together, but by motivating the community to strive towards a higher bar of quality, we think we were able to drive both numbers up.

Unfortunately, I believe that we've reached a plateau in that regard.

## The need for Flutter Funding

One of the jobs of the Flutter Favorite committee is to keep the needs of the community in mind and to work with authors on the cusp of meeting the quality bar get over that hump with encouragement and help. As one example, I remember reaching out to the author of a popular BLE package that needed some work. There was some missing functionality and some missing quality metrics, but it was a great start. The author told me that he'd love to bring it up to the FF quality bar, but he was too busy working to pay his mortgage and feed his family. If we perhaps had a small amount of funding, 

Unfortunately, there was no funding for such things at the time. And except [for the FlutterFlow Flutter Funding program](https://www.flutterflow.io/fund) (which sounds great, btw, but is going to be biased towards certain kinds of projects, I think), there is no multi-company organization who's job it is to fund engineering projects in the Dart and Flutter.

But I have an idea.
