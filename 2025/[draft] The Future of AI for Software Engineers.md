# The Future of AI for Software Engineers

TODO

## Fodder

- The future is here, it's just unevenly distributed

- Data points

  - a friend that runs 10 instances of Devin

  * an engineering manager that has no desire to hire more software engineers 

  * layoffs we haven't recovered from - salaries down for new hires

- Issue reporting becomes a way for humans + "admin" LLMs to communicate with "eng" LLMs

- Office Space: It's my job to bring the link from Jira to the LLM

- LLMs for eng

- LLMs for runtime error detection and reporting

- LLMs for PR review

- LLMs for analytics analysis

- all of our tools, programming languages, frameworks, etc. are a) designed for humans and their need for DX and b) by definition non-optimal for the task at hand

- Possible futures

  - Do we need eng reading/writing code? Why do we need that if the LLM is doing the bug fixing and feature implementation?
  - how many more custom apps will we need? doesn't the LLM, sufficiently capable, become the final app? 
    - I write throw away spreadsheets all the time
    - now I'm writing throw away apps: my poster example
  - we stall out somewhere along the way

- We're not there yet:

  - Link to the livestream with Craig and the amount of trouble they had making the LLM managing the state of the app vs. using traditional techniques to do that and using the LLM for sentiment analysis, etc. But we did use the LLM to write the state transition code, so...

- In the short term, for sure:

  - engineers using AI will be more effective than engineers that don't

- Biggest change since we moved from submitting jobs in batch to multi-user systems

- Jira is two things

  - Data about the issue or feature
  - Metadata about how important it is to the business

- The dial

  - Eng in denial
  - Eng using coding tools
  - Eng using jira tickets to drive coding LLMs
  - Eng using LLMs for code reviews
  - Eng building CI/CD pipelines using LLMs
  - Non-eng building analytics analysis using LLMs
  - (Future) Eng using LLMs to monitor logs for errors, perf issues, security breaches, abuse
    - Runtime LLMs logging jira tickets
  - (Future) LLMs pulling Jira tickets off the queue

- What does that mean for the future of software engineering as a profession?

  - I've been telling people for ten years that AI is replacing software engineering. classical AI aka ML, i.e. supvervised learning, etc. has been replacing the core algorithms in our software for a while now and generative AI just accelerates that.
