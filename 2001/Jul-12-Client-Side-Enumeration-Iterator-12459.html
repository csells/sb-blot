<h1>Client-Side Enumeration Iterator</h1>
<span class="created">July 12, 2001</span>
        
    <p>
        Have you ever been jealous of the VB programmer who could write this:
    </p>
    <pre>sub EnumVariants(col as Collection)
    dim v as variant for each v in col
        ' Do something with v
    next v
end sub</pre>
    <p>
        If so, you may be interested in the <a href="/12653">STL-style IEnumXxx 
            iterator</a> I've built. You'll also need a supporting file, <a href="/public/tools/atlcopies.h">
            atlcopies.h</a>.
    </p>
