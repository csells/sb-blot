<h1>ATL Composition</h1>
<span class="created">July 13, 2001</span>
        
    <p>
        I've developed a set of macros to support implementing interfaces using nested 
        composition in ATL (the one common way of implementing interfaces they 
        neglected). The benefit of composition is that it is easy to implement multiple 
        interfaces with methods with the same name but that require different behavior, 
        e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>interface IArtist : IUnknown {
     HRESULT Draw();
}

interface ICowboy : IUnknown {
     HRESULT Draw();
}</pre>
    <p>
        The benefit of this particular implementation is that it has no object size 
        overhead. Interfaces implemented using nested composition have no greater 
        overhead than using multiple-inheritance. Feel free to <a href="/public/tools/atlcompose.h">
            download atlcompose.h</a> for your own use.
    </p>
