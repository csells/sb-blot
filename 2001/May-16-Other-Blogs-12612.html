<h1>Other Blogs</h1>

                <p>
                    My spout page is just one of literally thousands of web logs ("blogs") 
                    available on the net. These are a few of the ones that I like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">SlashDot</a></b>. 
                    This is the first blog I ever saw and it's still really cool. Lots of Linux 
                    stuff, of course, but also lots of fun&nbsp; general-purpose technology stuff.
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.betanews.com/">BetaNews</a></b>. 
                    This has no commentary. It's just a list of software that's gone into beta 
                    recently. I often find interesting stuff here.
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a></b>. 
                        Joel Spolsky is an ex-Microsofty who runs <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">
                            Fog Creek Software</a> and has a lot of really good 
                        ideas when it comes to how to build software. He often 
                        says what I think, so I think he's a genius. : )<li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.dotnetdan.com/">Dot Net Dan's</a></b>. 
                    Dan Green aka "Dot Net Dan," is a guy who really likes .NET and once mentioned 
                    me right between Joel Spolsky and Stephen Hawking, so I think he's cool. : )
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/info/latest.asp">The CodeProject</a></b>. 
                    This is my favorite code posting site by far. There's something new there daily 
                    and I almost always start there when I'm looking for a hunk of code.
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.activewin.com/">ActiveWin</a></b>. This 
                        one is mostly an excuse to pay homage to Microsoft, but there's interesting 
                        Windows news up often enough that I still visit pretty regularly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>
                        <a href="http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/">
                        Jason Whittington: </a>
                        <a href="http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/">Managed Space 
                        blog</a>.</b>
                    Jason's another DevelopMentor guy heavy into .NET and particularly garbage 
                    collection (at least for the moment -- most of us have fairly short attention 
                    spans... : ).
                    </ul>
