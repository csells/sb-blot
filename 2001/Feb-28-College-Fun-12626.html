<p>In 
Japan, it is said, the impersonal and sometimes unhelpful Microsoft error 
messages have been replaced with Japanese haiku poetry. Maybe in the next 
upgrade to our Windows... </p><p>Your file was so big. <br>It might be very 
useful. <br>But now it is gone. </p><p>The website you seek <br>Cannot be 
located, but <br>Countless more exist. </p><p>Chaos reigns within. 
<br>Reflect, repent and reboot. <br>Order shall return. </p><p>Aborted effort. 
<br>Close all that you have worked on. <br>You ask far too much. 
</p><p>Windows NT crashed. <br>I am the Blue Screen of Death. <br>No-one hears 
your screams. </p><p>Yesterday it worked. <br>Today it is not working. 
<br>Windows is like that. </p><p>Stay the patient course. <br>Of little worth 
is your ire. <br>The network is down. </p><p>A crash reduces <br>Your 
expensive computer <br>To a simple stone. </p><p>Three things are certain: 
<br>Death, taxes and lost data. <br>Guess which has occurred. </p><p>You step 
in the stream, <br>But the water has moved on. <br>This page is not here. 
</p><p>Out of memory. <br>We wish to hold the whole sky, <br>But we never 
will. </p><p>Having been erased, <br>The document you're seeking <br>Must now 
be retyped. </p><p>I ate your Web page. <br>Forgive me; it was tasty <br>And 
tart on my tongue. </p><p>First snow then silence <br>This thousand dollar 
screen dies <br>So beautifully. </p><p>The Tao that is seen <br>Is not the 
true Tao, until <br>You bring fresh toner. </p><p>With searching comes loss 
<br>and the presence of absence: <br>"My Novel" not found. </p><p>See how in 
Haiku <br>All error messages are <br>Somehow more peaceful </p><p><i>Richard
