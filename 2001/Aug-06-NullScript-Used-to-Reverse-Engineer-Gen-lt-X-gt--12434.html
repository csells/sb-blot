<h1>NullScript Used to Reverse Engineer Gen&lt;X&gt;</h1>
    <p align="left">
        Wow. I'm impressed as all get out. <a href="mailto:HughDBrown@yahoo.com">Hugh Brown</a>
        has reverse-engineered Gen&lt;X&gt; as one of the tests of his <a href="http://www.iwebthereforeiam.com/projects/NullScript.asp">
            NullScript</a> implementation. I wish I would have had this when I started 
        Gen&lt;X&gt; a couple of years ago. It would've saved me figuring out how ASP 
        did it.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        My thinking along these lines years ago led me to go the opposite way, i.e. I 
        built a front-end ASP parser that generated script for VBS. I called it <a href="/12659">
            TextBox</a> (which, as a Win32 programmer, I should've realized was a 
        terrible name...).
