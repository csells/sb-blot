<h1>From COM to .NET</h1>
<p>

                    Enough people have asked me what I think about the transition from COM to .NET 
                    that I thought I'd publish my thoughts instead of responding to each individual 
                    email. This is the question that finally lead to me publishing this page in the 
                    first place.

                    In the early days of C, ASM was much more efficient, but C was much easier to 
                    use and as machines got faster, and C compilers got better, ASM was relegated 
                    to use by only a few. During the transition, ASM programmers were valuable and 
                    continue to be so for very targeted tasks, but they grow increasingly 
                    unnecessary. For example, in all the time that I've developed software (17 
                    years), I've needed ASM exactly *once* (and then I just used Keith Brown : ). 
                    To this day, I have to admit that I can neither write nor even read x86 
                    assembly. I've always meant to learn and I admit to being embarrassed that I 
                    can't, but I've never needed it. Each platform I programmed for, I started 
                    after the platform had moved away from ASM being the dominant programming 
                    environment.

                    As Microsoft ships increasingly stable betas of .NET towards a final release, 
                    we're nearing the end of a long and messy transition from processor-specific 
                    low-level programming to programming at a higher level on the Windows platform. 
                    To be honest, most Windows programmers are already there and have been for a 
                    while. They're the forward-thinking Visual Basic programmers. They recognized 
                    that they had no need to learn Win32 or COM. They could program at a 
                    comfortable level and make their C++ programmer friends do the grunge work for 
                    them. C++ programmers that haven't moved to VB yet had two reasons: the 
                    programs run too slowly and VB doesn't let me do what I want. With each 
                    successive release of VB, the efficiency argument has gotten weaker and weaker. 
                    Now that VB6 uses the same intermediate language and backend compiler that VC6 
                    does, speed's really no longer an issue. The 2nd reason, "VB doesn't let me do 
                    what I want," is real and continues through VB6. The problem is really the 
                    language. There is one feature that no C++ programmer can live without: 
                    implementation inheritance. It's so useful for day-to-day programming chores 
                    that we can't give it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This one fatal flaw in VB6 was made very clear to me the other day when I was 
                    doing .NET programming using C#. Before we go any further, let me make one 
                    thing perfectly clear: VB.NET *is* C#. The only difference is the syntax. The 
                    language features are all the same but one: you can write "unsafe" code in C#, 
                    but not in VB.NET. Unsafe code in C# is the equivalent of&nbsp; inline ASM: 
                    when you need it, you can't live without it, but you probably won't need it. 
                    So, when I'm programming C#, I could as easily be programming VB.NET. And the 
                    beauty of my experience of programming C# caused me to examine the difference 
                    between my previous VB6 experience and my current C# experience. I had a 
                    form-based drag-n-drop environment in both. I had IntelliSense in both. I had a 
                    programming model that was much simpler than raw Win32 in both. In short, C# 
                    and .NET gave me everything that VB6 gave me, but with one addition: 
                    implementation inheritance. When I needed to model the data for my application, 
                    it was so easy because I had inheritance but would've been so much harder 
                    without it. That feature made all the difference to me and is the reason that 
                    C++ programmers will finally feel free to move into the VB-like environment 
                    that .NET provides.

                <p>
                    Will everyone abandon the Win32 API when .NET ships? No. Will everyone 
                    eventually move their code over to .NET? No. Will most folks spend most of 
                    their time programming .NET within 18-24 months of ship? Absolutely, yes. It's 
                    too compelling a platform with too many real advantages to ignore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does that mean you should stop all development and wait for .NET to ship? 
                    Absolutely, no. Build you components in COM today and you'll be able to move 
                    them over to .NET when the time is right (which may be never). The .NET 
                    backwards compatibility story is a good one. You'll be able to continue to make 
                    use of most of your COM components and DLLs in .NET, which means that the code 
                    you're working on today will continue to be useful long after you've moved your 
                    day-to-day programming activities to .NET. To ease the transition, I recommend 
                    marking your COM interfaces with [oleautomation] if possible. This limits your 
                    method parameters to types and attributes that .NET is particularly good at 
                    marshaling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;.NET via C# and VB.NET is the future of programming for Windows, leaving 
                    Win32 and COM as the ASM of .NET.
