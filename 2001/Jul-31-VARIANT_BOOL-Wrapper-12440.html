<h1>VARIANT_BOOL Wrapper</h1>
<span class="created">July 31, 2001</span>
    <p align="left">
        CComBool is a class to prevent the misuse of the VARIANT_BOOL type. 
        VARIANT_BOOL is a problem because its legal values are -1 and 0 instead of 1 
        and 0, making converting back and forth between bool, BOOL and VARIANT_BOOL 
        problematic. CComBool supports the constructors and operators needed to convert 
        between the three C++ Windows Boolean types. It also supports operator&amp; and 
        CopyTo for common COM client and server usage. <a href="/public/tools/combool.h">CComBool is 
            available here</a>.
