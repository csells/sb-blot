<h1>Hanging Out My Shingle</h1>

                    For the last three years, I've been in management. Oh, it started innocently 
                    enough. When the team was small, I was only managing a little bit. However, as 
                    the team grew and we got closer and closer to shipping our first product, I 
                    spent less and less time doing anything technical and more and more time 
                    managing. Eventually, I was doing nothing but dealing with the rest of the 
                    company and potential customers and "enabling" everyone else. Luckily, Don Box, 
                    co-founder of DevelopMentor and my long-time mentor, noticed that I'd been 
                    swept right out of the things that I loved the most. And he made me an offer I 
                    couldn't refuse...
                </p>

                    Now I'm back on the consulting, teaching, writing, development train and loving 
                    it. I've been all over .NET for about a year, but now I get to concentrate on 
                    it full-time. If you'd like any consulting help in the area of .NET (or even 
                    COM and ATL), I'm here for you. Pass the word along. Thanks!</p>
