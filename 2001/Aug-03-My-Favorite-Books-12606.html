<h1>My Favorite Books</h1>
<p>
                    <i><span class="created">Friday, 8/3/01</span></i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I started writing books, I decided to stop reviewing other peoples' books. 
                    I used to have a list of all of the books in the topic of my current interest 
                    and write a little review, either pumping them or panning them (this was <i>long </i>
                    before Amazon.com). Once I decided to write books myself, I figured that 
                    there'd be a conflict of interest putting down competing books, so I stopped. 
                    However, I've had lots of folks ask me for a list of recommended books over the 
                    years, so I thought I'd provide one. While I'm still biased, there's at least <i>less</i>
                    conflict of interest if I just tell you about books that I love (although I'm 
                    not so proud that I don't tag each book URL with my Amazon.com associates 
                    ID...).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would give each of these books a 5-star rating on Amazon (and, in some cases, 
                    I've done just that). These are the books that I absolutely love (in no 
                    particular order):

                        <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0938151495/chrissells">
                                The PC Is Not a Typewriter</a> by Robin Williams.</b> Of course, this 
                        is not by the famous actor, but Robin is as famous in the type design field as 
                        the other Robin is in the funny joke field. In fact, I'd say the former is even 
                        more impressive, because she doesn't let herself get talked into writing bad 
                        books. You can't go wrong with any of Robin's books, but this is the first one 
                        of hers that I read and it still holds a special place in my heart. She 
                        specializes in teaching text design amateurs how to do text design and she's 
                        great at it.

                                Genetic Programming III</a> by J.R. Koza, et al.</b> It's no secret 
                        that I've long had a weakness in my heart for 
                            programs that generate programs. This one is the ultimate -- programs 
                        that figure out themselves how to generate the correct program. Very wow. And, 
                        as is necessary for all books on this list, it's very well written. It's 
                        gripping in the same way that the latest John Grisham novel is gripping (to a 
                        certain kind of person : ).

                        <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201634465/chrissells">
                                Essential COM</a> by Don Box.</b> This is not only the classic work on 
                        COM, but it captures the heart of the movement of Windows programmers into 
                        component development. Be careful when you pick it up, though. You could start 
                        by looking something up and find yourself hours later still reading it for the 
                        pure pleasure. BTW, Don and I have good close friends for years, so I may be 
                        biased (except I'm not -- this book rocks).

                                Don't Make Me Think</a> by Steve Krug.</b> I'm still in the middle of 
                        reading this book, but wow. It lays out web usability in a way that even a web 
                        design cretin like me can appreciate. He points out the dos and don'ts in a way 
                        that's clear, concise and entertaining. I'd love to be able to convey so much 
                        with so few words. And the production values of this book are great. I wonder 
                        if Addison-Wesley will let me write a .NET programming book in the same 
                        style...

                                User Interface Design for Programmers</a> by Joel Spolsky.</b> <a href="http://joel.editthispage.com">
                            Joel maintains one of my favorite web logs</a> and has collected his 
                        usability musings into a wonderful little book (clearly influenced by the Krug 
                        book). What makes this book so wonderful is that he captures all my feelings 
                        about usability, making me feel like an expert. Of course, I love a book that 
                        agrees with me. : )

                                Effective C++</a> by Scott Meyers.</b> This is the book that started a 
                        movement. Of course, if you're a C++ programmer, you need to read this book. 
                        But more than that, Scott laid out a style that has often been imitated, but 
                        never duplicated. (I know, because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201379686/chrissells">
                            I tried</a>.)

                                Mr Bunny's Guide to ActiveX</a> by Carlton Egemont III.</b> If you're a 
                        COM programmer, you need this book. Check out the close up of the pixel. It 
                        kills me every time.

                                C# Essentials</a> by Peter Drayton, et al.</b> This is hands down the 
                        best .NET programming book out there. It's clear, concise and accurate (a 
                        novelty in the Windows book market). It only took me a few hours to read, but I 
                        learned a ton. BTW, Peter works for DevelopMentor, but I'm not biased because I 
                        don't like him very much. : )

                                Fundamentals of Database System</a> by R. A. Elmasri.</b> This is one 
                        of the rare college text books that is not only readable, but practical. I read 
                        this after years and years of doing database work and was very surprised that 
                        they covered what software engineers actually need to know about how databases 
                        work.

                                Inside SQL Server</a> by Kalen Delaney.</b> Ironically, I haven't had 
                        much database experience under Windows (I was a Unix Informix guy), but when I 
                        read the earlier edition by Ron Soukup, I fell in love with this product. I'm 
                        sure it was the way that Ron described it, but I couldn't imagine doing SQL 
                        Server work without this book.

                                Modern Operating Systems</a> by Andrew S. Tanenbaum.</b> I sure wish I 
                        had had this book when I was taking my operating systems course in college, 
                        because then Linus Torvald would be reading about the success of my operating 
                        system and not the other way. This book is so great and so well-written that 
                        its inspiring. I firmly believe that every effective programmer needs to first 
                        understand what's going on underneath their drag-n-drop, click-button IDE and 
                        this book sure lays a great foundation.
                        <br>

                                Computer Networks</a> by Andrew S. Tanenbaum.</b> Along those same 
                        lines, Tanenbaum's networking book is also excellent. Makes me want to dig 
                        right into the plumbing.

                                TCP/IP Illustrated</a> by W. Richard Stevens.</b> Of course, the late 
                        Richard Stevens was a legend in the Unix community. This book, while slanted 
                        towards Unix, is still a great book about the world's most dominant network 
                        protocol. I can't decide whether I like this book or Computer Networks by 
                        Tanebaum better, but you can't go wrong by owning both.

                                Unix Network Programming</a> by W. Richard Stevens.</b> As a Unix 
                        programmer not even doing network programming, this was still the bible. I know 
                        that you Windows programmers aren't going to rush out and buy it, but if you 
                        wake up with a desire to program in a command line world, you'll need this 
                        book.

                                Philip and Alex's Guide To Web Publishing</a> by Philip Greenspun.</b> I 
                        don't know how much practical information there really is in this book, but 
                        after reading it, I really wanted to quit my job and go to work for <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/">
                            Ars Digita</a>. Unfortunately, after Phil brought in some "professional" 
                        management, they kicked him out and, as far as I can tell, are driving that 
                        company into the ground. Still, <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/">
                            the amount that that guy has contributed to the internet community</a> is 
                        staggering and inspiring.

                                ASP Internals</a> by Jon Flanders.</b> Now on this one, I'm very 
                        biased, because not only is Jon Flanders a fellow DevelopMentor employee, but 
                        he's also been one of my best friends since 3rd grade and I wrote the forward. 
                        That said, if you want to know how ASP really works, down to source code for an 
                        ISAPI extension that Jon builds to work just like ASP, you need this book. And 
                        what's so amazing is that he's able to convey so much so concisely. I wish I 
                        could write this briefly. I hope an ASP.NET Internals is forthcoming from Jon.

                        The C Primer. This book is long out of print, but it's where I learned the C 
                        syntax that has served me so well through so many languages, i.e. C++, Java, 
                        JavaScript and C#. I don't expect anyone to need this book anymore, but it does 
                        have a special place in my heart.
