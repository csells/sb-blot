<h1>What I Love Best About .NET</h1>
<p>
            <i><span class="created">Monday, 8/6/01</span></i>

            DevelopMentor has long attracted smart 
                folks. <i>Really </i>smart folks. These are the caliber of people that forces 
                you to look up every once and a while and question your own worthiness. With 
                this many high-caliber people together, you'd think they'd be able to look 
                objectively at the world and avoid such religious arguments as "What's the best 
                language?", "What's the best platform?" and "What's the best editor?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Nope.
        </p>
        <p>
            We get into arguments like this (and even more esoteric) stuff <i>all the time</i>. 
            Oh, open debate is healthy and we eventually come to a reasoned, balanced 
            decision, blah, blah, blah, but these kinds of arguments made me realize that 
            the thing I love most about .NET is that one of the most contentious arguments 
            has just gone away: "What's the best language?" In the old days, this boiled 
            down to VB vs. C++, otherwise known as practical vs. theoretical, simple vs. 
            complicated or even, my personal favorite, journalism major vs. computer 
            scientist. The argument was a real one, though, because VB6 and below put a 
            real straight jacket on you when it came to real object-oriented features (the 
            lack of implementation inheritance springs to mind), whereas C++ was so hard 
            for so many people, it was almost impossible to build correct code with it. 
            Much mud was thrown during these debates and no progress was ever made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, we have the same "What's the best language" arguments over VB.NET vs. C#, 
            but they always peter out very quickly. While it's true that VB.NET makes it 
            much easier to build late binding component clients and C# allows unsafe code 
            sections, neither of these features is enough for us to avoid agreeing that, 
            modulo syntax, the two languages overlap by about 90%. Which means, and now I'm 
            coming to the part that really makes me love .NET, <i>I get to work with lots more 
                smart people at DevelopMentor.</i> Before, it was about the <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=0394800893">
                star-bellied Sneetches and the plain-bellied Sneetches</a>. Since I felt I 
            was one with a star on his belly (doesn't everyone feel that way?), I couldn't 
            work with those without stars upon thars! Well, Sylvester McMonkey McBean, you 
            can teach a Sneetch! [1]
        </p>
        <p>
            I just got off the phone with a good friend of mine who I've never been able to 
            work with before, because we've always had a great divide between us caused by 
            my C++ bias. Now, for the first time, we get to work together! He can do his 
            stuff in VB and I can either work with it directly, or I can easily port it to 
            C#, because <i>all the classes and functions that he's going use in VB are going to 
                be identical to what I would do in C#.</i> So, while 90% of the language 
            features overlap, there's 99.999% overlap in the framework and how to use it 
            between the two languages. To answer Rodney King's immortal question, "Yes. 
            Finally, thank .NET, we can all just get along."
