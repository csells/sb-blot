<h1>Effective C# Available Today</h1>

            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201310058">Effective 
                C# is available now from Addison-Wesley</a>. Of course, it's called 
            Effective Java, but *wow* the overlap is amazing. Some of his items I don't 
            agree with, e.g. return zero-length arrays instead of null (although I see his 
            side) and others have been "fixed" due to advances in C#, e.g. override clone 
            judiciously, but so much of it makes sense in C# (and .NET in general) that 
            it's scary. I feel like asking AW for the text so that I can port it to C# over 
            the weekend. : )
