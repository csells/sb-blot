<h1>College Fun</h1>
<p>I spoke at a 
college last week for a friend of mine who's an adjunct professor (Cal 
Caldwell). During the talk, one of the male attendees bolted &lt;sigh&gt;, but 
on his way out, trusted sources say that, when sighting a young coed whom our 
our bolter was clearly interested in engaging with in some way, he said, "Hey! 
Do you know who's in there? Chris Sells!" Clearly this young man was misguided 
in his attempt, but I'm glad to hear that someone thinks that using my name 
will help in attracting members of the opposite sex. It's never worked for 
me... : )</p>
