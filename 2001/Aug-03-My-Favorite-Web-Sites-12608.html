<h1>My Favorite Web Sites</h1>
<p>
                    <i><span class="created">Friday, 8/3/01</span></i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are the sites that I visit on a regular basis and like (the sites I visit 
                    on a regular basis and don't like are not listed : ):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></b><a> is the 
                            greatest search engine on the planet. I used to use others, but now, why 
                            bother?</a>
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/">Dictionary.com</a></b><a><b> </b>
                            is a necessity for me because I'm a terrible speller (although it didn't help 
                            me spell repitwa earlier today!). Plus, it has a thesaurus and an acronym 
                            expander. I'm impressed a number of folks when they've tried to use wacky 
                            anonyms on me and I can pretend like I knew it all along.</a>
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        <b>The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Groups</a> page</b>
                        is a great place to start and maintain groups. I've got 
                        one myself (the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic">
                            Windows Technical off Topic group</a>).
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">CodeProject.com</a>. </b>
                        Whenever I need a hunk of code that I haven't written myself, I start here.
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://joel.editthispage.com/">Joel on Software</a></b>
                        is one of my favorite blogs. I think he's a genius because he says stuff I 
                        agree with.<br>
&nbsp;<li>
                        I use the <b><a href="http://www.imdb.com">Internet Movie Database</a></b>
                        all the time to settle arguments over movies, find related movies, find release 
                        times, etc. It's been around for a long, long time and is still a really great 
                        site.
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        The <b><a href="http://discuss.develop.com/">archive for 
                                DevelopMentor's mailing lists</a></b> is invaluable. I've avoided 
                        looking silly so many times by searching here first before sticking my foot in 
                        my mouth (actually, I could stand to use it a lot more, come to think of it : 
                        ).
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://discuss.microsoft.com/archives/">Microsoft's mailing 
                                list archive</a></b> is useful, too.
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        Whenever I need a map, <b><a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a></b>
                        is there.
                        <br>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        Whenever I need a computer (not quite as often as I need a map, but often 
                        enough...), I use <b><a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/dfh/default.htm">
                                Dell's Refurbished computer site</a></b>. You have to make sure you're 
                        getting exactly what you need and you might have to stake it out a few days to 
                        make that happen, but the prices are so good on slightly handled Dell computers 
                        with the same warranty as the new ones, that I wouldn't buy a computer anywhere 
                        else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
