<h1>Conference.NET: Notes from the Field</h1>
<p>
            <i><span class="created">August 17th, 2001</span></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In talking to fellow DevelopMentor instructor Craig Andera today, I realized 
            that those of you who didn't get to attend
                DevelopMentor's Conference.NET this week, must've hoped that 
            DevelopMentor's inaugural conference would suck so that you didn't miss 
            anything good. Well, I'm pleased to tell you that it didn't suck. In fact, it 
            was awesome. In further fact, I can't say that I've ever had more fun at a 
            conference. Of course, I couldn't be everywhere, but here's what happened to 
            me:
        </p>
        <h2>
            Day 1: Chris Doesn't Suck
        </h2>
        <p>
            Monday started with a rousing keynote from David Chappel, the industry's 
            best-dressed speaker (not a high bar in our industry, of course, but even I 
            have to admit that he's very good looking : ). <a href="http://www.devx.com/free/hotlinks/2001/ednote081501.asp">
                An overview of his talk is available here</a>, but what I most remember is 
            that he pegged C++ as for dinosaurs only. While I certainly see his point,
            <a href="/public/writing/#mcxx">
                Microsoft's Managed Extensions to C++</a> are going to enable a lot of 
            people to enter the world of .NET without rewriting large code bases, which is 
            going to make it enormously popular. This was further evidenced by the volume 
            of MC++ questions that I fielded all week long (one attendee left the lab 
            unhappy with the answer he'd gotten from a C# bigot and dragged me back there 
            to examine his problem). Like VB before it, I predict MC++ to be the .NET love 
            that dares not speak its name. Of course, David's comments weren't exactly 
            designed to fill my day-long MC++ tutorial later that day...
        </p>
        <p>
            Further compounding my potential attendance problem was going to be Don Box. 
            Don's an amazing man. He has the ability to dive completely into a technology, 
            understanding it better than the designers, while still remembering the 
            technical details of every other technology he's ever ingested and completely 
            belittling any value they might have had when compared to his latest fetish. <a href="http://www.devx.com/free/hotlinks/2001/ednote081501.asp" target="_parent">
                In his talk</a>, C++ didn't respect the programmer, VB was the bane of 
            every other programmer, COM was a mess and of course people had trouble getting 
            DCOM to work over the Internet (how could it work when our neck-bearded network 
            administrators had been replaced with kids pulled away from flipping burgers by 
            the siren song of readily available MS networking certification?). Of course, 
            to Don, only .NET and C# are at all useful to the reasonable, thinking 
            developer. My biggest issue with Don is how right he usually is, but when he 
            singled me out as destined to be the world's last C++ programmer by painting an 
            image of me in a '76 Ford truck sporting a gun rack and a bumper sticker 
            reading, "You can have my C++ when you pry it from my cold dead fingers," I 
            knew that those attendees who hadn't yet decided weren't likely to show up in 
            my MC++ tutorial...
        </p>
        <p>
            The last 2/3rds of my day was spent teaching my first real material in about 
            three years. Oh, I'd given the odd conference talk now and again, but after 
            years on the sidelines managing the development of 
                Gen&lt;X&gt;, I was nervous. After all that time, could I still manage 
            to entertain and educate a room full of people on a topic that the keynote 
            speakers had spent all morning panning? As it turns out, I can. Oh, I can't say 
            I was brilliant, but I didn't suck, and that was enough.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Day 2: Chris Has a Bad Hair Day
        </h2>
        <p>
            Day 1 ended with lots of celebration of my not sucking. I got to hang out with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201616181/chrissells">
                dear friends from as far back as 3rd grade</a> and enjoy a bit more alcohol 
            than was strictly necessary. After finally collapsing into bed at around 
            5:30am, I was hardly in any shape for my 8am business breakfast (note to self: 
            never let the commission-based sales guy schedule the meetings -- they're just 
            too damn eager). Needless to say I grabbed every minute of sleep that I could, 
            but because of my short, deathlike REM, my hair was remarkably unmussed when I 
            showed up without a shower (and even managed to make a point or two without 
            falling asleep in my waffle). After two hours of scintillating business 
            wrangling, I retired to my room to grab some quick Zs before returning to 
            "office hours" in the lab. The lab was really great, because it contained a 
            couple of hundred PCs with exercises from each of the conference talks so that 
            attendees could practice what they'd learned, getting help from the rotating 
            speakers pulling lab monkey duty and answering attendee questions about designs 
            scrawled on cocktail napkins. This was also where I learned that my continued 
            lack of a shower had finally made it's way to my hair. After thirty minutes of 
            frightened stares, I stopped by the gift shop to buy a hat (stupid looking, but 
            better than the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&amp;group=0217869&amp;photo=9&amp;path=gallery&amp;path_key=0217869">
                Elijah Prince</a> "do" I was sporting) on the way to my first Birds of a 
            Feather talk.
        </p>
        <p>
            The BOF that I was to do with Brian Randell, a died in the wool VB guy, was 
            entitled "WinForms: Love it or leave it," and it was designed for two things: 
            1) to leave things very open to audience participation and 2) to make sure that 
            Brian and I could show up without any preparation whatsoever. You see, both of 
            us had fallen in love with WinForms, but we hadn't gotten to do much with it. 
            We showed some fun demos, though. Mine was dedicated to the splitting and 
            docking that WinForms has built into it (a thing of beauty!). Brian's was 
            dedicated to the new opacity property setting which makes windows imperceptible 
            (how very useful...). So, after me making fun of Brian about this fetish, he 
            was getting a bit tense. Then, when the WinForms designer decided to crap out 
            because of a license file problem, causing Brian to have to shut down the IDE, 
            delete files manually, restart the IDE, etc, he got even more tense. When Don 
            decided to rub it in with his standard, "You know, when I use Emacs, that never 
            happens," Brian snapped. Before I even had a chance to draw a breath to put Don 
            back in his place, Brian came right back with, "And how many products did you 
            ship last year, Don?" A low moan swept the audience and Don turned tail and ran 
            (after waiting a few minutes to let the ruckus die down). It was an awesome 
            site to behold! I gained much respect for Brian that day.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also gained much respect for WinForms. In spite of all of the hype about 
            ASP.NET and Web Services, the thin-client backlash was in full swing at this 
            BOF. Our room started out full and just gained people as it went on. Somewhere 
            in the middle it became standing room only and still people came. And they 
            didn't just sit there, either. They all participated in a very rousing 
            discussion first about MFC/VB vs. WinForms and then onto the more interesting 
            thin vs. rich client. These people were very tired of the limitations of HTML 
            3.2 and cross-platform DHTML and anxious to get back to a real development 
            environment for UIs. <a href="http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0107B&amp;L=DOTNET&amp;P=R49813&amp;D=0&amp;H=0&amp;O=T&amp;T=1">
                Truly, the Renaissance for rich UIs has begun</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Day 3: Jason Whittington is Accused of Slut-like Ignorance
        </h2>
        <p>
            Day 3 was a big day for me. It started with a talk on a subject near and dear 
            to my heart, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201309777/chrissells">
                generative programming</a>. This is a relatively new term for the 
            technology ideas we'd been using for years in building Gen&lt;X&gt;. Again, my 
            room was full, not only of attendees but also of two of the software engineers 
            from the Gen&lt;X&gt; team (Chris Tavares
            and <A href="mailto:shawnv@adoguy.com">Shawn Vanness</A>). The audience was 
            certainly spending a lot of time nodding their heads and understanding the 
            benefits of generative programming, but when I showed them
                how far we had taken it and 
                all of the things for which we were using Gen&lt;X&gt;, that took them 
            right over the top.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, right after getting to pitch my favorite technology, I got to proceed 
            right to my next BOF, where I would get to tilt at my own personal windmill -- 
            non-deterministic finalization. Those of you who know me or my programming 
            style know that I'm absolutely in love with the idea of objects managing their 
            own resources and them being notified immediately when the last client is done 
            with them, either via COM-style reference counting or via a C++ destructor. 
            This kind of deterministic finalization allows for very aggressive reclamation 
            of resources, even in the face of exceptions or forgetful programmers. 
            Non-deterministic finalization, on the other hand, leaves notification that an 
            object is no longer in use to a background thread managed by a garbage 
            collector. Because <i>when </i>the GC will get around to notifying an object is 
            non-deterministic and empirically takes a long time, this means that resources 
            can no longer be claimed by automatic means, instead leaving it to the client 
            to manually notify the object via a Close or Dispose method. In my opinion, 
            this is not a robust technique in the face of exceptions or forgetful 
            programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This issue has been the bane of my existence for years. When Java was first 
            becoming popular, I was studying to become DevelopMentor's first Java 
            instructor. And at first, I really liked it. Then I discovered that Java had 
            non-deterministic destruction and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201695898/chrissells">
                my life turned to ATL instead</a>. Fast forward a few years to an early 
            design preview of .NET where I learn that Microsoft was "leveraging" many of 
            the ideas of Java in its new runtime, including my favorite: non-deterministic 
            finalization. I try to explain the problems inherent in this decision, but 
            apparently, they've been all through this and <a href="http://www.ddj.com/news/fullstory.cgi?id=4609">
                Bill Gates has already made the decision for them</a>. Of course, I don't 
            know this, so I kept fighting the good fight with <a href="http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0007&amp;L=dotnet&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=26432">
                one of the first emails</a> on <a href="http://discuss.develop.com/dotnet.html">
                DevelopMentor's .NET mailing list</a>. This caused quite a stir, consuming 
            much bandwidth to this day and eventually culminating in a <a href="http://discuss.develop.com/archives/wa.exe?A2=ind0010A&amp;L=DOTNET&amp;P=R28572">
                long, explanatory email from Brian Harry</a>, a PM on the .NET team. This 
            email was intelligent and thoughtful and annoyed me no end because it put the 
            final nail into the coffin containing my hope for DF in v1.0 of .NET, which 
            we're going to be living with for years. In fact, this email annoyed me so much 
            that, on Day 2, I referred to it as "Brian Harry's 'little' email." After all, 
            the room was nearly empty except for a few of my very close friends and one 
            attendee who I hadn't met. I met him 5 seconds later. It was, of course, Brian 
            Harry. Remember, this was the day I had almost zero sleep, so I wasn't exactly 
            on top of my game. What an inauspicious way to meet your arch-enemy... [1].
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I told you that story so that I could tell you this one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The BOF was to be a debate between me (pro-DF) and <a href="http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/">
                Jason Whittington</a> (pro-garbage collection), with Don as the master of 
            ceremonies. Imagine a thoughtful, reasoned exchange of ideas between calm, 
            measured adults. Now throw that image away. Instead, Don introduced the BOF by 
            saying that there was the right way of thinking and the Chris way of thinking 
            and that I had been lured into the packed room (containing, as backup for the 
            side of evil, Brian Harry) for an "intervention." Now, it's not as if some of 
            us didn't try to be thoughtful and reasoned. For example, Jason gave us all 
            kinds of background into the history and practice of garbage collection and how 
            it works under .NET. In fact, if you haven't yet had a chance to read <a href="http://www.develop.com/conferences/conferencedotnet/materials/C2.pdf">
                Jason's GC talk from Conference.NET</a>, you should. It's great. 
            Unfortunately, the passions in the audience and in the other side of the 
            debate, i.e. me, left little time for Jason's approach. Instead, Don and I and 
            the audience went back and forth, invoking stories of ASP.NET applications 
            written by the cream of the crop at DevelopMentor that leaked so many resources 
            as to make them unusable, laments of the semantic incorrectness of tying 
            resource management to object lifetime and analogies of deck chairs on boats 
            that did and didn't sink. It was somewhere between a gospel revival and a 
            schlock talk show (in fact, at one particularly cantankerous moment, the 
            audience was literally chanting "<a href="http://www.studiosusa.com/jerry/">Jerry! 
                Jerry!</a>"). At one point, I got so worked up during Jason's attempts to 
            shed some actual light on the topic that I interrupted him exclaim, "Jason 
            Whittington, you ignorant slut!" It was one of the highlights of my life...
        </p>
        <p>
            But that was not to be the highlight of the show. Oh no. The most amazing thing 
            about the show was later that evening at the close of conference party, where 
            DevelopMentor introduced the .NET Band: The Band on the Runtime, made up of 
            speakers and attendees who were also accomplished musicians. It was an awesome 
            mix of showmanship, musicality and <A href="/public/fun/#conf.net.songs">parody lyrics</A>
            that caused the audience to sing along, wave their candles (in lieu of 
            lighters), jump on stage and scream for an encore. When it was over, I was so 
            moved that, in spite of my long friendship with Don and my pride in never 
            seeing him as the hi-tech rock star that most folks do, I had to rush backstage 
            to shake his hand and to be in his presence. I felt like a giddy school girl 
            hoping to snatch a sweaty handkerchief from across his brow (which I'll be 
            auctioning off at eBay when I'm good and ready...).
        </p>
        <h2>
            Day n: The Rest of My Life
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have to say that I was deeply affected this week at Conference.NET. I'd like 
            to thank everyone who organized it and hosted it and made it happen. And those 
            of you who had the chance to go, but didn't? Well, on your heads be it. Don't 
            make that mistake again next year...
