<h1>Conference.NET Song Lyrics</h1>
<h3>King of the Code </h3><p><i>Sung to "King of the Road"</i> 
</p><p>Platform for sale or rent <br>who cares where all the others went 
<br>no more pointer, pushes, pops or peaks <br>I ain't got no memory leaks 
<br>I wrote ten lines of C# today <br>I was more productive than yesterday 
<br>I'm a programmer of mean by no means <br>I'm a king of the code <br><br>I 
feel sorry for those guys at Sun <br>DOTNET has got them on the run <br>But 
when I hear Scott McNeally whine <br>I say stick your VM where the Sun don't 
shine <br>Most folks agree VB DOT NET <br>Is the best version of Java that 
we've seen yet <br>I'm a programmer of mean by no means <br>I'm a king of the 
code <br><br>You C guys think all this stuff is new <br>A friendly runtime 
that hides the goo <br>I'm a VB guy, better watch out for me <br>'cause I've 
been writing managed code since 93 <br>Database code's busted -- no time to 
cry <br>Patch it all to the newest API <br>I'm a programmer of mean by no 
means <br>I'm a king of the code <br><br>New waves they come and go so fast 
<br>COM was love, but love don't last <br>If COM was love than what's DOTNET 
<br>It's love without the cigarette <br>DOTNET will be here till we all get 
bored <br>Then we'll throw it away and invent DOT-ORG <br>I'm a programmer of 
mean by no means <br>I'm a king of the code </p><h3>Wild Side </h3><p>Bill G 
came from Seattle WA <br>Spread .NET across the USA <br>Plucked out pointers 
on the way <br>Shaved ref counting - started sporting GC <br>He said Hey babe 
take a walk on the wild side <br>Hey babe take a walk on the wild side 
<br><br>Chris Sells never once threw one away <br>In the end, he had to pay 
and pay <br>An object here, and object there <br>Memory is the place where 
they say <br>Hey Chrissie, take a walk on the wild side <br>I say hey babe, 
let's going back home and finalize <br><br>And the .NET girls go <br>Do do do 
do do do do do do do <br>do do do do do do do do do <br>doooooooooooooooo ah 
<br>&nbsp; <br>&lt;break&gt;The musical stylings of Francesco 
Balena&lt;/break&gt; <br><br>Jon Flanders came from out of the heartland 
<br>With ASP he's was everybody's darling <br>But he never lost his head 
<br>Even when they told him COM was dead <br>I said hey Jon, take a walk on 
the wild side <br>I believe they call it Interop-O-cide <br><br>Brian Randell 
came and hit the streets <br>Hoping .NET would bring inter-language peace 
<br>He hates it when those bigots say <br>C#'s for work, VB's for play <br>I 
say hey Brian, take a walk on the wild side <br>It's curly braces that make 
your code bonafide <br><br>My friend Don Box, he's just coding away <br>Though 
he was James Joyce for a day <br>Yeah I guess Don's pretty smart <br>But he 
mistakes his code for art <br>I say Hey Don, take a walk on the wild side 
<br>You're just a liquor salesman, it can't be denied <br><br>And the .NET 
girls go .... <br><br>And the .NET girls go <br>Do do do do do do do do do do 
<br>Do do do do do do do do do do <br>Do do do do do do do do do do <br>Do do 
do do do do do do do do <br>Do do do do do do do do do do </p><h3>Bill G and 
the Feds </h3><p><i>Sung to "Bennie and the Jets"</i> </p><p>Hey kids - you 
wanna see a scene-o <br>Let's watch Billy Gates get it on with Janet Reno 
<br>We're talking anti-trust now - so stick around <br>Gonna rack legal bills 
that know no bound <br>Hey Joel Kline he's on the case <br>Oh man he's so 
spaced out <br>B-B-B-Bill G and the Feds <br>Billy he's so silly and litigical 
<br>The center of a courtroom scene <br>He's got those Harvard roots, class 
action suits <br>You know I read it in a magazine - oh yea <br>B-B-B-Bill G 
and the Feds <br><br>Hey kids, go crank up your browsers <br>You're in for 
nasty weather, gonna make you wet your trousers We're <br>gonna stifle

Netscape down to their knees Hey Judge Jackson, have you <br>heard this case
