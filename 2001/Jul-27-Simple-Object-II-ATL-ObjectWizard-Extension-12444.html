<h1>Simple Object II ATL ObjectWizard Extension</h1>
<span class="created">July 27, 2001</span>
    <p>
        The Simple Object II ATL ObjectWizard Extension (whew -- I've got to come up 
        with a shorter name...) provides the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Support for [oleautomation] interfaces.
        <li>
        Support for the Neutral-threaded apartment.
        <li>
        Support for IDispatch-based interfaces other than duals.
        <li>
        Better support for disabling features that do not make sense together, e.g. FTM 
        + ThreadingModel=Apartment.
        <li>
            Updated pop-up help.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Originally, SimpleObject2 was built to do away with the one benefit of 
        IDispatchImpl over IDelegatingDispImpl -- wizard support. As do most 
        things developed under the greedy eye of my colleagues, it grew 
        to support a few more features than that. It's available for download <a href="/public/tools/SimpleObject2Setup.exe">
            here</a>. Enjoy.&nbsp;
    </p>
