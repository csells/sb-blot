            Is it imitation or nudity that's the sincerest form of flattery? Either way, it 
            looks like <a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/discuss/msgReader$337">
                Robert Scoble is naked outside</a> where the neighbors could see (unlike <A href="/public/fun/centerfold/">
                mine</A>, which was inside and very private : ).
        </p>
