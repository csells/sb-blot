            The World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked today when hi-jacked 
            commercial airlines crashed into them, destroying both of the towers and 
            damaging the Pentagon. I can't possibly know what the people who had friends 
            and families in those buildings are going through right now, but my thoughts 
            and prayers are with them. If there's anything you can do today or in the 
            coming weeks or months to help those people to recover from their loss, please 
            put aside your computers and your work and do it. I will be doing the same. 
            Thank you.
