<h1>Expando Objects</h1>
<span class="created">Aug 2, 2001</span>
    <p align="left">
        I've seen lots of interest lately in expando objects, e.g. objects that can add 
        methods and properties on the fly. Joe Graf wrote <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mind/defaulttop.asp?page=/mind/1099/dynamicobject/dynamicobject.htm&amp;nav=/mind/1099/inthisissuecolumns1099.htm">
            a piece on IDispatchEx in MIND</a> that was pretty interesting. <a href="/public/tools/MyExpando.zip">
            My own implementation of IDispatchEx is available here.</a> It supports 
        expando objects that have no static properties or methods as well as those that 
        do. Check out the DispExTest.js for a demonstration, dispeximpl.h, 
        dynamemlist.h and dynamemlist.cpp for the implementation and MyExpando.h for 
        the usage.
