<h1>CComVector: A SAFEARRAY Wrapper</h1>
<span class="created">July 26, 2001</span>
    <p>
        I got tired of not having a smart type for SAFEARRAYs, so I built one. It's 
        limited to one dimension (does anyone use multi-dimentional SAFEARRAYs?) and 
        provides one class for the SAFEARRAY and another for the data itself (the lock 
        is a resource, too), but the usage is pretty nifty. See <a href="/public/tools/comvector.h">comvector.h</a>
    for the what and the how.
    <p>
        Also, Ron Jacobs sent me an ATL port of COleSafeArray called CComSafeArray that 
        I've made <a href="/public/tools/CComSafeArray.zip">available here</a>.
