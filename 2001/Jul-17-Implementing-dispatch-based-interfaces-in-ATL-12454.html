<h1>Implementing dispatch-based interfaces in ATL</h1>
<span class="created">July 17, 2001</span>
        
    <p>
        There are three kinds of ways to declare a dispatch-based interface in IDL, but 
        ATL (as of version 3.0), only supports the implementation of 1.5 of them (duals 
        and a raw dispinterfaces for handling events).&nbsp; The <a href="/public/samples/atldisp.zip">
            ATL Dispatch Sample</a>demonstrations the use of three ATL-based classes, 
        one for implementing each type of dispatch-based interface. The header file 
        that defines these classes, <a href="/public/tools/dispimpl2.h">dispimpl2.h</a>, is provided 
        for use in your own projects.</p>

        BTW, thanks to Ehab Kashkash for making this code work under VS.NET as 
		well as VC6.</p>
