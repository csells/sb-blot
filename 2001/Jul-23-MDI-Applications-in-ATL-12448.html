<h1>MDI Applications in ATL</h1>
<span class="created">July 23, 2001</span>
    <p>
        At <a href="/public/tools/atlmdi.zip">atlmdi.zip</a>, please find Charles Petzold's famous 
        raw Win32 MDI application, MDIDemo, ported to ATL. See atlmdi.h for a set of 
        base classes for building MDI applications in ATL and mdidemo.cpp for an 
        example of their use.
