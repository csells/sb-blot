<h1>TZ Data to XML Project</h1>
        <p>
            These are the outputs of my attempts to translate the <a href="ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/">
                native tz data</a> into XML for easier parsing for applications other than 
            implementations of the standard C routines related to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the first step in a project to merge time zone and map data by the Time 
            Zone Map Group, lead by <a href="mailto:cellis@gaz.com">Chuck Ellis</a>.
        </p>

                <a href="/public/tools/tz/tz2xml.zip">tz2xml.zip</a>: A VC++ program to translate native tz data 
                files into XML. Warning: This requires a certain directory structure and a few 
                modified files from the tz code to export shared functions. I'm working to fix 
                that.</li>
