<h1>Bill's Money</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.abcnews.com/sections/scitech/gates2020_0130/">In a recent 
                interview with Barbara Walters</a>, Bill Gates was asked how he felt about 
            Ted Turner's one billion dollar donation to the United Nation. This is what he 
            had to say:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                &#147;Certainly, my giving will be in the same league as Ted&#146;s, and 
                beyond. &#133; During my lifetime, you know, the money will be given 
                away.&#148;
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            He further went on to say:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                &#147;I don&#146;t believe in passing on major wealth to (one&#146;s) children, 
                and therefore everything that I&#146;m earning is going toward the causes that 
                I think can help out.&#148;
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            So far, Bill has given several hundred million dollars to libraries to provide 
            lower income children with access to PCs and the Internet. Do you have an idea 
            for a charity worthy of Bill's Money? Post your comments here and I'll keep track of them for Bill. When he's 
            ready, he'll know where to come.

            P.S. Just so you know, Bill has never once supported anything from this 
			page and as far as I know, he has no idea this page even exists. 
			Don't get your hopes up.</p>
