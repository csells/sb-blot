<h1>My Favorite Software</h1>
<p>
                    <i><span class="created">Friday, 8/3/01</span></i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following software is what I install on nearly every computer I set up. 
                    BTW, I pay for all my favorite software and you should, too. While I am guilty 
                    of "trying" friend's software, I own legal copies of every piece of software I 
                    use.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/">Windows XP</a>.</b>
                        The grand unification of Win9x and Windows 2000 is finally at hand (isn't that 
                        one of the signs of the apocalypse?) and it is awesome. The UI make over is 
                        great, but the two killer features for me so far (I've only have RC2 running 
                        for a few days at this point) are the new Terminal Services client (called 
                        Remote Desktop Connection and hidden under Accessories\Communications) is 
                        amazing for the keystroke handling alone and the ClearType support for LCD 
                        panels. Unfortunately, the latter is going to force me to buy LCD panels for 
                        all my computers and will make using the former with anything by Windows XP 
                        unbearable. No wonder they have a monopoly...
                        <br>

                    <li>
                        <b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office">Microsoft Office XP</a>.</b>
                        I know that they're a monopoly. I know that they should be broken up. But damn, 
                        they just make killer (sic) software! As a writer and web maintainer, I 
                        absolutely love Word and FrontPage. The last real feature they added was red 
                        and green squiggles, but now I can't live without them. As a guy dealing with 
                        lots of email and people and tasks, I live in Outlook. The fact that the 
                        integration with Word is now fast enough to let me use Word as my editor (to 
                        get red and green squiggles) has cut <i>way </i>back on people making fun of me 
                        for my shoddy emails. And while I can't say I've ever used 1% of the features 
                        in Excel, for whipping up a quick set of numbers and totals, there's nothing 
                        like it. Also, I was a proud owner of Visio 1.0, so that fact that they now 
                        bundle it is awesome. Truly, without Office, I may very well have skipped to 
                        Linux by now, but I'm addicted.

                        planet. This is #2 reason why I haven't gone to Linux.

                        the flash of some upstart comes and goes out of my life.

                            from Green Parrots Software.</b> This is a free-form hierarchical 
                        information keeper. While I practically live in Outlook, it has never had a 
                        good way to keep bits and pieces from my head. And what I especially love is 
                        that, as a keyboard only boy, I can navigate between the tree view on the left 
                        and the text view on the right, including adding topics, moving topics, etc, 
                        all without taking my fingers off the keyboard, including starting it from 
                        Start-&gt;Run (via "action"). The only thing that I wish they'd add is 
                        encryption and password protectionbecause I'm embarrassed to tell you just what 
                        kind of information I keep in there in plain text (Keith "Mr. Security" Brown 
                        would not approve : ). Indispensable.

                            Green Parrots Software.</b> Actually, Green Parrots is one of my favorite 
                        software companies. They make some cool stuff. I can't live without 1st Clock 
                        for two reasons:
                        <ol>
                    <li>
                    It puts the day of the week and the date in the toolbar (because I can never 
                    remember and the time it takes to click my way to that info is too long).
                    <li>
                        It lets me put custom strings into the toolbar. I always put the machine name 
                        in the toolbar so that as I switch between multiple PCs sharing a single 
                        keyboard, mouse and monitor using my <a href="http://www.belkin.com/">
                            Belkin OmniView</a>, I can tell at a glance what machine I'm currently 
                        working with.
                    </li>
                    </OL>
                        <p>The built-in automatic time synching with internet time service is really 
                    cool, too.

                        another. It's not as cool or as fast as the new Terminal Services client from 
                        Microsoft, but it lets you control the currently active Windows station instead 
                        of starting up a new one, so it's great for controlling the PC I have connected 
                        to my home theater, from the comfort of my couch (ever try to read PC output on 
                        a TV across the room? It doesn't work...).

                                DevTrack</a> from TechExcel.</b> DevTrack is a good bug tracking 
                        database. Even though it is <i>not</i> one of my favorite pieces of software 
                        (sorry to throw you for a loop there : ), it was so much easier to set up than 
                        any of the competitors at the time and it did 80% of what we needed it for, 
                        that we live with it. The web client enables developers to use it all over the 
                        world and we were able to squeeze the data out of it that we needed. We do 
                        struggle with it sometimes, but not nearly as much as we would have had to if 
                        we'd have built out own from scratch. In fact, that's why I list it here. <b><i>Please 
                                don't waste your time writing your own bug database. </i></b>Buy one. 
                        If I had it to do over again, I would definitely spend time looking at <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/">
                            FogBUGZ</a> from Fog Creek Software.

                            SourceGear. </b>Source Offsite is an NT service that allows access to your 
                        Visual SourceSource database across the internet. Until they fixed a mighty 
                        leak problem that required us to manually kill the server a couple of times a 
                        day, Source Offsite was a depressing maintenance headache that we had to put up 
                        with, because when it worked, it worked <i>so </i>well, and there wasn't 
                        anything else out there. Now that the leak is fixed, it just silently works. 
                        What more can you ask from a piece of software?

                            Canyon. </b>Mike Woodring and I go way back. Like me, he also has a bend 
                        for building tools and a website where he makes them available. The one that I 
                        absolutely cannot live without is CleanVC (he's got other cool tools worth 
                        check out, too). From the command line, CleanVC takes the name of a directory 
                        and recurses through it and all sub-directories, killing all the intermediate 
                        files you get during a build. From the shell, you can right-click on a folder, 
                        choose CleanVC and get the same thing. I use it right before I zip something up 
                        for distribution and I use it to dig through my own project directory just 
                        before my weekly backup. Fabulous.

                        This is a simple .reg file that I built way, way back that lets you right-click 
                        on a COM DLL or EXE and register or unregister it. It's simple, I know, but I 
                        find I can't use my computer without it.

                        smart enough to take out spaces and &gt; characters when an URL is split 
                        between forward lines in an email. To use, copy the URL (with spaces and weird 
                        characters and all) into the clipboard and run UrlRun.exe. It will take the URL 
                        out of the clipboard, clean it up and start up IE.
