<h1>Command Line Parsing</h1>
<span class="created">Aug 3, 2001</span>
    <p align="left">
        I got tired of not having getopt under Win32 and the best version to port 
        doesn't handle slashes (as per the Windows standard) or @files for arguments 
        and it requires you to give away the source for every app that uses it, so, 
        inspired by my friend Josh Gray,&nbsp; <a href="/public/tools/CommandLineParser.zip">I built my 
            own</a>. It supports typed flags and params, @file support and building 
        full usages on the fly.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        Plus, the latest version has support for parsing ANSI or Unicode argfiles, as 
        provided by <a href="mailto:johan.nilsson@esrange.ssc.se">Johan Nilsson</a>. 
        Thanks, Johan! Also, I've added a contribution by <a href="mailto:Paul.Westcott@IGT.com">
            Paul Westcott</a> to support arguments with restricted values. Thanks, 
        Paul! And, as if that weren't enough, <a href="mailto:adis.delalic@vianova.no">Adis 
            Delalic</a> contributed <a href="/public/tools/clp.pdf">a UML diagram to describe how the CLP 
            is built</a>. Wow.
    </p>

        And as if that weren't enough,
        <a href="http://www.develop.com/kbrown">Keith Brown</a>
        <a href="/public/tools/CommandLineParser7.h">ported the command line parser to VS.NET</a>. 
        Thanks, Keith!</p>
