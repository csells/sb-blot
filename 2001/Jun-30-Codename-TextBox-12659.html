<h1>Codename TextBox</h1>
    <h2>
        The Need for Code Generation
    </h2>
    <p>
        Have you ever wanted to generate code like the wizards do, i.e. start with a 
        template, mix in some symbols and boom, out comes the code? If you're building 
        a custom AppWizard, you define code like so:
    </p>
    <pre>    int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE, LPSTR, int nShow) {
    $$IF(coinit)
        // Initialize COM
        CoInitialize(0);

    $$ENDIF
        // Initialize the ATL module
        _Module.Init(0, hinst);
    $$IF(axhost)

        // Initialize support for control containment
        AtlAxWinInit();
    $$ENDIF

        // Create and show the main window
        HMENU   hMenu = LoadMenu(_Module.GetResourceInstance(),
                       MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDR_$$ROOT$$));
    ...
    </pre>
    <p>
        This is fine if you've got the MFC-based interpreter building your code and 
        you're willing to live within the boundaries of a very small set of features. 
        The ATL Object Wizard-style of generation is similar, i.e.
    </p>
    <pre>    class [!ClassName] : 
     public CAxDialogImpl&lt;[!ClassName]&gt;
    {
    public:
     [!ClassName]()
     {
     }
    [!crlf]
    ...
    </pre>
    <p>
        Again, only good if you're running under the ObjectWizard and again, somewhat 
        limited. What you really want is to be able to do things ASP-style, e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>    <span class=asp>&lt;%@ language=vbscript %&gt;</span>
    <span class=asp>&lt;% ' test.cpp.asp %&gt;</span>
    <span class=asp>&lt;%</span>
        <span class=asp>greeting = Request.QueryString(&quot;greeting&quot;)</span>
        <span class=asp>if len(greeting) = 0 then greeting = &quot;Hello, World.&quot;</span>
    <span class=asp>%&gt;</span>
    // test.cpp

    <span class=asp>&lt;% if Request.QueryString(&quot;iostream&quot;) &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot; then %&gt;</span>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;
    <span class=asp>&lt;% else %&gt;</span>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    <span class=asp>&lt;% end if %&gt;</span>

    int main()
    {
    <span class=asp>&lt;% if Request.QueryString(&quot;iostream&quot;) &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot; then %&gt;</span>
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;<span class=asp>&lt;%= greeting %&gt;</span>&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    <span class=asp>&lt;% else %&gt;</span>
        printf(&quot;<span class=asp>&lt;%= greeting %&gt;</span>\n&quot;);
    <span class=asp>&lt;% end if %&gt;</span>
        return 0;
    }</pre>
    <p>
        In this case, you get the same effect as the other two, but you've got the full 
        power of a scripting language. However, for this to work, you had to run under 
        ASP... until now...
    </p>
    <h2>
        TextBox
    </h2>
    <p>
        TextBox is a ASP-like script host that will process any file you give it 
        looking for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        text blocks
        <li>
        script blocks (&lt;% script %&gt;)
        <li>
        output blocks (&lt;%= output %&gt;)
        <li>
            An optional language block as the first line in the file <i>only</i> (&lt;%@ 
            language= language %&gt;)
            <br>
        (TextBox defaults to vbscript and currently only works with vbscript and 
        jscript).
    </ul>
    <p>
        TextBox pre-processes the text to turn the whole thing into into script and 
        hands it to the scripting engine for execution, outputting the result to 
        standard out. Whatever features of the scripting language you want to use, feel 
        free.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Usage
    </h2>
    <p>
        To provide for I/O, TextBox emulates ASP somewhat. It provides two intrinsics, 
        the request object and the response object. The Request object has a single 
        property, QueryString, that works just like ASP. The Response object has a 
        single property, Write, just like ASP. In fact, if you only use 
        Request.QueryString and Response.Write, you should be able to test your script 
        files using ASP.
    </p>
    <p>
        To set name/value pairs for use by the script via the Request object, the usage 
        of TextBox is like so:
        <pre>    usage: textbox &lt;file&gt; [name=value]</pre>
    <p>
        For example, to interpret the file above, any of the following command lines 
        would work:
    </p>
    <pre>    textbox test.cpp.asp
    textbox test.cpp.asp greeting=&quot;Double Wahoo!&quot;
    textbox test.cpp.asp iostream=true greeting=&quot;Double Wahoo!&quot;
    </pre>
    <p>
        The first would yield the following output:
    </p>
    <pre>    // test.cpp

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main()
    {
        printf(&quot;Hello, World.\n&quot;);
        return 0;
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
        while the last would yield the following:
    </p>
    <pre>    // test.cpp

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Double Wahoo!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 0;
    }
    </pre>
    <h2>
        Errors and Debugging
    </h2>
    <p>
        If the scripting engine finds an error, it will notify TextBox, who will notify 
        you. However, if you've got script debugging enabled on your machine, the 
        scripting engine will ask you if you'd like to fire up the debugger, showing 
        you exactly the offending code.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Not Just Code
    </h2>
    <p>
        Of course, TextBox is good for the generation of any text, not just code.
