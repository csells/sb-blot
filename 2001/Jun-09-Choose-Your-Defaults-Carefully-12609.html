<h1>Choose Your Defaults Carefully</h1>
<p>

                    In the last week, I've been bitten twice by developers that have chosen 
                    defaults poorly and, therefore, have adversely affected my life. The first was 
                    on my Nokia phone. I was in a "meeting" with some of my key engineers (read: we 
                    were goofing off at a movie on a Thursday afternoon), and I had set my phone to 
                    Silent mode. Now, I have a <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/beauty/1,2498,,FF.html?zipcode=97007&amp;rowid=49">
                        Nokia 8260 (blue)</a> that I dearly love. It kicks butt on <a href="http://ericsson.sundial.com/ericssoncobrand/modules/ericsson_cobrand/phone_info.asp?phone_id=374">
                        the silly Ericsson</a> that I used to have. However, I noticed when I came 
                    out of the meeting that their had been several calls from my blushing bride. 
                    The Nokia is cool not only because it's small enough to fit into my pocket 
                    (where I keep it during our "meetings"), but also because it has a vibrate 
                    mode. So, I figured that if the phone was in Silent mode, but the phone was 
                    still on, if someone called, I'd get the vibrate in my pocket (separate from my 
                    change and my keys to honor the spirit of the Nokia Silent profile). 
                    Unfortunately, this was not the case. Calls came in, but no vibration was 
                    forthcoming. This happened a couple more times in the next few days until I had 
                    a free moment to check the settings for Silent mode (ironically this free 
                    moment came while waiting for another movie to start today -- "Operation: 
                    Swordfish," which I enjoyed, btw). The default for the vibrate setting in the 
                    Silent profile was *off*. How could this possibly be right? It's a phone! It's 
                    on! Sure, I want it silent so it doesn't bug people around me, but I still want 
                    to know when someone calls! Hence the vibrate mode! Needless to say, my 
                    blushing bride was less than pleased.

                    The second time that incorrect defaults interrupted my life happened to be a 
                    bug recently found in Gen&lt;X&gt;. 
                    Because Gen&lt;X&gt; installs some COM components, we require it to be 
                    installed by an account that's part of the Administrator group. Unfortunately, 
                    the bug is that once Gen&lt;X&gt; is installed, another user can't use it on 
                    that machine unless they are also part of the Administrator group. Of course, 
                    since 98% of developers run with Admin privileges on their own machines, this 
                    bug was never reported by the secular community. So how did we find it? It was 
                    reported by none other than Keith "Mr. Security" Brown, who was experimenting 
                    with running at a lower level of security for some perverse purposes that I can 
                    only imagine... Anyway, when Keith calls you with a security bug, you listen 
                    (at least it was the good kind of security bug, i.e. offering less access then 
                    we should instead of more. I can only imagine what the phone call would be like 
                    if Keith discovers that we've opened a hole...). The problem with security? 
                    Defaults.

                    The author of CRegKey, a class in ATL we were using to read the serial number 
                    out of the Registry, built in a default access level setting. We use the 
                    Registry key when our tools are started to make sure that user has a valid 
                    serial number on their machine -- standard stuff. You need to be an Admin to 
                    write the key, but you shouldn't have to be just to read it. However, the 
                    default setting in the CRegKey::Open method is set to allow read-write 
                    permissions, as show here:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <pre>LONG Open(HKEY hKeyParent, LPCTSTR lpszKeyName, <b>REGSAM samDesired = KEY_ALL_ACCESS</B>);</pre>
                <P>
                </P>
                <p>
                    The developer who wrote the code (let's call him "Shawn"), being a human with 
                    many tasks interested in doing them all efficiently, left off the default 
                    value, assuming that the default would be read-only. This was the correct 
                    assumption to make if you assume that the CRegKey author was specifying his 
                    defaults properly. Unfortunately, he wasn't, so when we tried to merely read 
                    the SN out of the Registry, we were asking for read-write permissions, and the 
                    read failed, causing the SN validation to fail, keeping Keith from using 
                    Gen&lt;X&gt; and motivating him to call me and complain about it. All due to 
                    bad defaults.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Rules for Defaults
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Defaults are often set to save typing. That's a bad idea. If the Nokia guy and 
                    the CRegKey guy had but followed the these simple rules for determining 
                    defaults, my life would have been better:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Apply "the principle of least surprise."</b>
                    I'm sure he didn't invent this rule, but it's one I learned from Don Box and it 
                    sticks with me as one of "the seven good ideas" that exist in our field (a 
                    story all its own). The principle of least surprise says that you make 
                    interface design decisions based on what people expect. Shawn expected the 
                    default access level to be read-only. I expected my phone to vibrate in Silent 
                    mode. Pretend that the default isn't even an option. What would people expect?
                    <li>
                        <b>Minimize the harm of inadvertently choosing the default.</b>
                    Assuming the defaults are not changed (a very common occurrence), what bad 
                    things could happen? If the default had been read-only on CRegKey, unit testing 
                    a code path that required read-write would have immediately uncovered that 
                    greater access was needed, a fix could have been immediately supplied and no 
                    harm done (except some extra typing). However, because the default was 
                    read-write, we introduce an invisible bug that Keith has to find. Likewise, if 
                    the default had been vibrate in Silent mode, when a call came in, it would 
                    still have been silent, but I would have been notified of the call. Again, no 
                    harm (assuming no holes in your pockets and that you're wearing underwear). 
                    However, because of the default, I missed calls and angered my wife. That 
                    didn't happen with the Ericsson.
                    <li>
                        <b>Change defaults sparingly.</b> Once you've chosen your defaults and released 
                        your thing, people are going to learn those defaults and depend on them. For 
                        example, we can't go back into our ATL source and update the default to 
                        CRegKey::Open because we've got all kinds of code paths through our code 
                        depending on the default. If you change a default, even if the default was set 
                        incorrectly to begin with, you're doing more harm than good. Unless you can 
                        change the defaults without inducing harm, don't.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, not all developers follow these rules, so when you make use of 
                    defaults, please double-check them first.
                </p>
