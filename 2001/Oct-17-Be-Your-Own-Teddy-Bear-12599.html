<h1>Be Your Own Teddy Bear</h1>
<p>

            According to legend, the TA office next to the Stanford computer science lab is 
            guarded by a teddy bear. Before a student is allowed to consume valuable time 
            asking a question of the TA, they must first explain it to the teddy bear. 
            Apparently the bear is able to answer 80% of the questions that students ask, 
            saving time for the TAs to play Unreal Tournament.

            I often feel like I act as the teddy bear for the COM community. I get several 
            email messages a day from folks that consider the <a href="http://discuss.microsoft.com/">
                mailings</a> <a href="http://discuss.develop.com/">lists</a>
            (resources set up to answer just these kinds of questions) to be too slow, so 
            they ask me directly. If I don't know the answer off of the top of my head, I 
            often respond with the following phrase:
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you send me a tiny, tiny project that reproduces the 
            problem? --Chris"
        </p>
        <p>
            This, of course, implies that I will actually build and debug the project. And 
            20% of the time, I do. The other 80% of the time, by the time folks have 
            reduced the problem enough to demonstrate it for me, they've already solved it, 
            saving me the time (thank goodness).
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing that this is the case, I recommend that you become your own teddy bear. 
            A whiteboard is handy for explaining the problem to yourself and Microsoft 
            development tools are now so handy that you can typically whip out a small 
            reproduction project very quickly. These very activities will often solve the 
            problem, but even if they don't, you've got a concise description of the 
            problem and a small repro case to send to your friends or to post to the list.
