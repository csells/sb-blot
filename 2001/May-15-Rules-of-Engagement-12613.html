<h1>Rules of Engagement</h1>

                    This is a page where I can just spout off about whatever. I keep it separate 
                    from my <A href="/public/tools/">Tools</A> page so that you don't mix up any of my 
                    spoutings with facts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I&nbsp; get started, I'd like to lay some ground rules. First and 
                    foremost, I'd like to warn you that every human on the planet has an agenda, 
                    often more than one. These are some of mine:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I want to <b>make people's lives better</b>. This drives pretty much 
                    everything I do. Since my education is in computer science and my sphere of 
                    influent is developers, most of what I do is to help that sub-species of human 
                    known as "developers." Recently I've been experimenting with ways to help 
                    normal humans, but what these people want is foreign to me, so it's 
                    slow going.<li>
                        I'm interested in <b>putting food on my table</b>. For the same 
                    reason, I'm interested in what's good for me and my family. This drive  is the most potentially dangerous to you if you're going 
                    to put any stock into my spoutings. Be warned.<li>
                        I'm interested in <b>what I'm interested in</b>. Once I 
                        like something, I often like it for a long, long time. 
                        However, only one thing at a time can really consume me 
                        and you're likely to hear about it here.</ul>
                <p>
                    The second ground rule is that while I try to be as accurate as possible, I'm 
                    human and I make mistakes. If you find a mistake or you think my opinion is 
                    just so wrong that it requires a response or you'd just like to respond in 
                    general, feel free to send me email at <A href="mailto:csells@sellsbrothers.com">csells@sellsbrothers.com.</A></p>
