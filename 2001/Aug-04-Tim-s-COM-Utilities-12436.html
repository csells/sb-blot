<h1>Tim's COM+ Utilities</h1>
<span class="created">Aug 4, 2001</span>
    <p align="left">
        The great and powerful Tim Ewald (author of <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201615940">
                Transactional COM+: Building Scalable Applications</a></b> and personal 
        friend of mine) put together <a href="/public/tools/cputil.h">a handy little set of COM+ classes 
            and utility functions</a> in a concise header file that he has graciously 
        allowed me to host. Among my favorites are IsInActivity, IsInTransaction, 
        IsSecurityEnabled, GetCallersName,&nbsp; IsCallerInRole, and parameterized 
        versions of CoGetObjectContext and GetAspObject (which is even cooler than my 
        CAspPtr). <a href="/public/tools/cputil.h">Download the code!</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201615940">
            Buy the book!</a> Feed your brain!
