<h1>Setting the Completion Character</h1>
<p>
        <i><span class="created">Aug 7, 2001</span></i>

        Whenever I set up a new machine (which happens a lot as WinXP and .NET go 
        through their beta &amp; RC cycles), I always need to manually set up the 
        completion character (to TAB, of course) in the Registry. <a href="mailto:shawnv@comguru.com">
            Shawn VanNess</a> <a href="http://discuss.microsoft.com/SCRIPTS/WA-MSD.EXE?A2=ind0001B&amp;L=ATL&amp;P=R3986">
            posted a .rgs file</a> that would set this up without the lengthy search 
        through the Registry. Inspired by Shawn, here's my own <a href="/public/tools/completionChar.reg">
            completionChar.reg</a> that doesn't require a program to parse .rgs files 
        (which doesn't come with Windows).
    </p>

        BTW, if you don't know about the command shell's Completion Character, stop 
        right now, run the <a href="/public/tools/completionChar.reg">completionChar.reg</a> file, 
        start up a WinNT/Win2K/WinXP command shell, type "cd c:\p[TAB]" and watch while 
        the shell expands it to "cd C:\Program Files\" for you. If you have other 
        directories that start with "c:\p", continue to hit [TAB] to cycle through 
        them. This works for any directory or file name and it boosts my productivity 
        by about 100% on the command line. I can't live without it!</p>
