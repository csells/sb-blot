<h1>.NET XML Checker and Validator</h1>
<p>
        <i><span class="created">Aug 8, 2001</span></i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/public/tools/xmlValid.zip">xmlValid</a> is simple command line utility that will 
        check an xml file for well-formedness and, optionally, will validate it against 
        a supplied XML schema file (xsd). I built it to check that my site's HTML files 
        were well-formed (and therefore XHTML-compliance), but it's got all kinds of 
        other uses, including checking .NET .config files. Source is included. Enjoy.
    </p>
    <pre>Usage: xmlValid.exe xmlFile [xsdFile]</pre>
    <p>
        Note that this utility requires .NET beta 2 to be installed.
