<h1>Too Many Secrets</h1>

            During my three years as director of a software project, I learned a lot about 
            people. In fact, I have a little text file entitled "My life as a dog" that may 
            find a home on this site one day. However, because of a thread on the <A href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/1718">
                Windows Technical Off Topic</A> list, one of the things I learned came 
            roaring back like a bad acid trip.

            The #1 problem with any organization is always communication. You can do 
            postmortems on projects all day long and only #2 and above will be a surprise. 
            The problem is that to build anything of any size, you need a team. As soon as 
            you have to communicate what's in your head to some number of other people, 
            it's going to happen imperfectly. The best way that we've been able to come up 
            with to deal with this issue is hierarchical structures to practice selective 
            information hiding, i.e. exactly the way we build software.
        </P>

            However, unlike software, humans have feelings and as soon as they perceive 
            that somebody is hiding something from them, they resent it. Again and again, 
            when I see information withheld to hide "bad" news, those being hidden from 
            know something is up and they get upset. And when they're upset, they send 
            emails and IMs and phone calls around the company looking for every scrap of 
            information they can find, all the while ignoring the work that suddenly seems 
            a waste of time in the face of impending doom. The surprising thing is that 
            when folks are given the truth openly and honestly, no matter how bad it is, 
            they almost always dig in and deal with it. Just knowing that they're trusted 
            with the secrets of the company seems to boost morale.

            I'm not saying that everyone needs to post their daily activities for everyone 
            to see -- that's too much information. But I am saying that everyone from the 
            CEO on down should be open about the issues they face, including being open to 
            scrutiny and suggestions. I find that after doing that long enough, folks 
            working for me tend to trust me to make the right decisions, leaving them to 
            focus on their own work.
        </P>

            The key is that, unlike software systems where components have information 
            hidden from them by their clients, humans can only be effective if they know 
            that the information is available when they want it. Information hiding still 
            needs to happen, but <EM>it's humans that need to choose to hide information from 
                themselves.</EM> It whole thing falls apart if the managers do the hiding.
