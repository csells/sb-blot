<h1>Fixing the External Dispatch in ATL + IE5</h1>
<span class="created">July 22, 2001</span>
    <p align="left">
        Are you getting this: "Error: object doesn't support this property or method" 
        when you try to call a method on your ATL HTML Control exposed external 
        dispatch (accessed via window.external in the HTML of the control)? Did it used 
        to work with IE4 and now it doesn't with IE5? That's because the ATL boys 
        played fast and loose with the identity laws of COM and, while it took the COM 
        police a while to catch up with them, catch up with them they did.

        of the problem and my solution to it.</p>
