<h1>Attila</h1>
    <p>
        Attila stands for "ATL for Applications." Attila is a set of extensions built 
        on top of ATL to provide application-level services in the same flavor as MFC. 
        Towards that end, Attila uses a lot of the same notions as ATL, e.g. heavy use 
        of templates, static binding and reliance on the compiler and the linker doing 
        their job.&nbsp; Also, in the flavor of ATL, Attila is under-documented and 
        requires a lot of user investment to make use of it. However, once you do, we 
        think you'll find the flexibility and efficiency worth it. If you don't, you 
        haven't lost much, 'cuz Attila is free. <a href="/12652">Enjoy</a>.
