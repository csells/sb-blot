<h1>Smart IEnumVARIANT</h1>

    <p>
        Visual Basic and its variants (sic) use IEnumVARIANT to implement the For-Each 
        statement. Unfortunately, they only ask for 1 element at a time, leading to 
        terrible performance across apartments. I propose two solutions. One allows you 
        to wrap any collection in a CollectionBuffer object and set the buffering 
        yourself, e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>Dim collBuffer As Object
Set collBuffer = CreateObject("SmartEnumSvr.CollectionBuffer")
collBuffer.Collection = coll ' coll is an interface on any collection
collBuffer.BufferSize = 1024 ' How many items would you like buffered?

c = 0
For Each v In collBuffer ' Uses SmartEnumVARIANT to buffer items
    c = c + 1
Next v
MsgBox "Counted " &amp; c
	</pre>
    <p>
        The second solution allows you to leverage SmartEnumVARIANT on the server-side, 
        seamlessly to the client. <a href="/12654">A detailed explanation and code 
            is available here.</a></p>
