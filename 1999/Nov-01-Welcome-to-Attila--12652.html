        <h1>
            Welcome to Attila
        </h1>
        <p>
            Attila stands for &quot;ATL for Applications.&quot; Attila is a set of 
            extensions built on top of ATL to provide application-level services in the 
            same flavor as MFC. Towards that end, Attila uses a lot of the same notions as 
            ATL, e.g. heavy use of templates, static binding and reliance on the compiler 
            and the linker doing their job.&nbsp; Also, in the flavor of ATL, Attila is 
            under-documented and requires a lot of user investment to make use of it. 
            However, once you do, we think you'll find the flexibility and efficiency worth 
            it. If you don't, you haven't lost much, 'cuz Attila is free. Enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Attila isn't a class library. Some of the headers depend on some of the others. 
            Some are stand-alone. You are free to pull in the pieces of Attila that you 
            need and leave the rest alone. Most of the headers were built by different 
            folks and while every effort was made to keep things consistent by choosing ATL 
            design techniques, everyone does things there own way.

            Installation
        </h1>
        <p>
            The current Attila bits are located at <a href="/public/tools/attila/attila.zip">
            attila.zip</a>. Download and unzip them 
            into the folder of your choice (making sure to preserve path names). Make sure 
            to add the Attila include directory to your compilers include path. For 
            example, if you unzipped Attila into the <b>c:\attila</b> directory, add <b>c:\attila\include</b>
            to your compiler's include path. You can check to make sure you did this right 
            by building any of the samples in the <b>samples</b> folder.
        </p>

            Support
        </h1>
        <p>
            Please do not send Chris Sells or any of the other contributors personal email 
            complaining about Attila. Also please do not post Attila bug reports to any 
            other mailing list, e.g. DCOM or ATL. If you like, you can submit bugs to the 
            Attila Hit Squad mailing list (but only if you're a member). Nobody there is 
            under any responsibility to fix anything in Attila, but you might shame someone 
            into it. A much better way to contribute to the life of Attila is to submit the 
            fix along with the bug report. Or even better, join the Attila Hit Squad 
            mailing list and fix bugs submitted by others.

        <p>
            You might find some implementation notes for Attila in the <b>docs</b> folder, 
            but you probably won't. If you have any documentation you'd like to submit, 
            we'd love to have it.

        <p>
            Check the <b>samples.htm</b> file in the <b>samples</b> folder of the Attila 
            distribution. You can build all of the samples from the command line using the <b>buildall.cmd</b>
            batch file in the <b>samples</b> folder.

                single instance ATL application from running at a time. DDE application name 
                should be based on something unique to the application, e.g. the module name.</li>
