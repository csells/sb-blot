<h1>Abort, Retry, Ignore</h1>
<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary, <br>System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor, <br>Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, <br>Still I sat there, doing spreadsheets: <br>Having reached the bottom line, <br>I took a floppy from the drawer. <br>Typing with a steady hand, I then invoked the SAVE command <br>But got instead a reprimand: it read "Abort, Retry, Ignore." </p><p>Was this some occult illusion? Some maniacal intrusion? <br>These were choices Solomon himself had never faced before. <br>Carefully, I weighed my options. <br>These three seemed to be the top ones. <br>Clearly, I must now adopt one: <br>Choose Abort, Retry, Ignore. </p><p>With my fingers pale and trembling, <br>Slowly toward the keyboard bending, <br>Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored, <br>Praying for some guarantee <br>Finally I pressed a key -- <br>But on the screen what did I see? <br>Again: "Abort, Retry, Ignore." </p><p>I tried to catch the chips off-guard -- <br>I pressed again, but twice as hard. <br>Luck was just not in the cards. <br>I saw what I had seen before. <br>Now I typed in desperation <br>Trying random combinations <br>Still there came the incantation: <br>Choose: Abort, Retry, Ignore. </p><p>There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted <br>Getting up I turned away and paced across the office floor. <br>And then I saw an awful sight: <br>A bold and blinding flash of light -- <br>A lightning bolt had cut the night and shook me to my very core. I <br>saw the screen collapse and die "Oh no -- my database", I cried I <br>thought I heard a voice reply, "You'll see your data Nevermore." </p><p>To this day I do not know <br>The place to which lost data goes <br>I bet it goes to heaven where the angels have it stored. <br>But as for productivity, well <br>I fear that it goes straight to hell <br>And that's the tale I have to tell <br>Your choice: Abort, Retry, Ignore. </p><p>
