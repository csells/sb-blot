<h1>Signs that you have hired the wrong COM developer...</h1>
<ul><li>Keeps referring to interfaces as "Thingies". <li>Insists that migrating to NT5.0 is a bad idea because the going rate for a rental-threaded apartment is $640.00 a month plus utilities. <li>Comes into work one morning dressed as a cowboy and claiming to be "The new marshaller in town". <li>Wants to know how to tune his TV to the "RPC Channel". <li>Stands up in design meetings, grabs his crotch, and proclaims "Yo! Marshall this! Am I right?". <li>Names one of his interfaces "IKnown" and claims that any object that doesn't implement it is doomed to eventually fall victim to a "COM Identity Crisis". <li>Spends 2 hours in front of a whiteboard trying to prove that by taking the integral of the GUID generating function, one can discern the total surface area of the application's UI in pixels. <li>Pronounces GUID as "gooeey dee".</li></ul>
<h2>P.S. </h2><p>Here's a picture of the t-shirt that Microsoft produced for their 1999 Dallas TechEd that <i>leverages</i> Tony's idea without giving him credit, asking him permission or even notifying him.
