            The Source
        </h2>
        <p>
            After 6 years of keeping the sample code of my Windows Telephony 
            Programming book up to date, I couldn't do it any more. Since I 
            literally haven't written a TAPI program since I shipped the book 
            (although I wrote tons of them for years before that), I'm was just 
            trying to stay ahead of Microsoft's compiler changes, the service 
            packs and the platform SDKs. I'm already two technology waves beyond TAPI 
            and no longer up on the latest in that space.</p>
        <p>
            So, <a href="mailto:vze3tcmc@verizon.net">Robert 
            Bamberg</a> is taking over the support of the source code for the 
            book. He does telephony consulting and is
            <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/robert.bamberg/csells.htm">maintaining the code for the book on his site</a>. Thanks, Robert!</p>

            Hardware/Software Requirements
        </h2>
        <p>
            I built most of the samples under Windows 95. They should work equally well 
            under Windows 98, but none of the audio applications will work under Windows NT 
            (like tMonitor) unless you're using a TSP that supports the audio media mode. 
            Unimodem under NT4 or Win95 doesn't support audio. Unimodem/V, which can be 
            installed on Win95 and comes out of the box on Win98 and NT5/Windows 2000, does 
            support audio applications, assuming you've got compatible hardware. For the 
            book, I used an external Supra Voice Modem. Nothing else would work (and 
            believe me, I tried everything available at the time). However, there's been 
            other modems built since then. If you'd like to take a look at other possible 
            modems, check out <a href="http://www.sunny-beach.net/Modems/Modemlist.htm">
                http://www.sunny-beach.net/Modems/Modemlist.htm</a>, which lists a set of 
            modems that Sunny Beach tested for the Personal Receptionist product. No 
            guarantees, though, as I haven't compared these modems myself.

            FAQ
        </h2>
        <p>
            Two questions come up again and again:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Why doesn't my modem work as a voice modem?</b> This is something to take up 
                with your modem vendor. Ask about TAPI and Unimodem/V support. Please don't ask 
                me to debug your modem.
                <br>
            &nbsp;
            <li>
                <b>How do I do fax with TAPI?</b> I haven't done any fax work with TAPI. My 
                background is integrated voice response (IVR), not modems. The reason the data 
                modem stuff is in the book is because I like the movie <i>War Games</i>. If 
                you'd like to do fax with TAPI, check the TAPI FAQs:

            TAPI Explorer</h2>
	<p align="left">I built the TAPI Explorer (tExplorer) to allow me to 
	understand the various capabilities of the telephony devices installed on my 
	system when I was developing TAPI applications and writing my TAPI book. It 
	grew into a utility for showing all line, address and phone capabilities as 
	well as other TAPI settings, e.g. country codes, telephony locations, 
	service providers, etc. If you're running into TAPI errors that you don't 
	understand, TAPI Explorer will help you work through them.</p>
<img src="/public/tools/texplorer.GIF" width="300" height="240" />
	<p align="left">This version has been run and tested on Windows 98, Windows 
	ME, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 and Windows XP and supports TAPI versions 
	1.4 through 3.1.</p>
