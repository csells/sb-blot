<h2>
  TAPI Explorer
</h2>
<p align="left">
  I built the TAPI Explorer (tExplorer) to allow me to
  understand the various capabilities of the telephony devices installed on my
  system when I was developing TAPI applications and writing my TAPI book. It
  grew into a utility for showing all line, address and phone capabilities as
  well as other TAPI settings, e.g. country codes, telephony locations,
  service providers, etc. If you're running into TAPI errors that you don't
  understand, TAPI Explorer will help you work through them.
