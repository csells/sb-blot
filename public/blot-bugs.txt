images:
+check out http://csells.blot.im/public/post-images. Some of them show directly in the browser (good). Some of them download (not good). At least one of them shows as text (bad).
  e.g. http://csells.blot.im/public/post-images/13740-258.png


misc:
+changes are taking a lot longer to propagate then they used to; it used to be seconds and now it’s minutes.
+the display of tagged posts, e.g. http://csells.blot.im/tagged/tools, shows a title “Entries tagged” but doesn’t say with what it’s tagged like it used to, e.g. “Entries tagged ‘tools’”.
+links are showing (blue underlines or anything else) on http://csells.blot.im//writing
+at the bottom of some (all?) of the pages, thereÕs a link with this text: "Subscribe to the RSS feed for 's blogÓ (notice the blank before the Õs). Where do I fill in the data to fill in that blank?


404s:
-need to be able to see 404 errors and provide redirects to improve site over time

+need to provide URL pattern rewriting, e.g. /posts/details/<peramlink> => /<permalink>
 the following URLs need to be forwarded:
  /news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=<permalink? => /permalink
  /posts/details/<peramlink> => /<permalink>
  /askthewonk => /writing/#qanda
  /colophon => /tagged/colophon
  /conference => /public/conference/index.htm
  /fun => /tagged/fun
  /interview => /tagged/interview
  /money => /tagged/money
  /tools => /tagged/tools
  /wahoo => /tagged/wahoo
+/tinysells/{code} => various (depends on the code)
+would like to be able to provide a custom 404 page
+need to be able to optionally turn off auto-404 page and expose the 404 errors for tools to track (no need)

Feature Requests:
-Google AdSense App: easily enabled for sidewall ads
-would like to have an app that shows social sharing features, e.g. share to Twitter, Facebook, G+, etc.
-Twitter integration: integrate the blog posts and tweets into a single, unified feed
-would like the option to have a title tacking onto the URL along with my permalink, e.g. http://134/the-title-goes-here
  -either link would work, i.e. just the permalink and the permalink + title
  -this is handy for SEO
  -this is handy for readers of just the URL


sorting:
+the sorting on the tagged pages is wrong (seemingly random), e.g. http://csells.blot.im/tagged/spout


pages:
+writing.html has "Page: yes" set, but is showing up as a blog post


Markup processing on HTML files:
+1995\Jan-01-Initial-Launch-12641.html (and everything else):
  article title doesn't line up along the top with the date of the article for default template (it's wrapping the initial HTML comment in a <p>)
  need to be able to put Blot metadata into comments for HTML files so that it remains valid HTML

+1997\Jun-27-Welcome-to-MeowMoniker--12656.html:
  the embedded line endings are reflected in the output instead of being ignore as per HTML rules

+2000\Aug-08-DM-in-the-Wall-Street--12628.html:
  random formatting because of the intermitten blank lines that I don't begin to understand

+2001\Feb-16-Genghis-12427.html:
  the indents on the HTML is causing the HTML to be set as code like Markup instead of interpretted as HTML


metadata:
+Jun-27-Welcome-to-MeowMoniker--12656.html:
  I’ve specified the Date, Tags and Permalink metadata, but only the Date is used – the Tags and Permalink are ignored.


Apps:
+need to be able to provide custom disqus_url format to pull in existing Disqus comments
+turning off the automatic caption from the image alt text doesn't actually stop the captions from showing


Templates:
+Essay template home page shows 31 (?) of the most recent posts, but provides no paging UI to get to previous posts
