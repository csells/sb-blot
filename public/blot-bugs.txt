images:
-check out http://csells.blot.im/public/post-images. Some of them show directly in the browser (good). Some of them download (not good). At least one of them shows as text (bad).
  e.g. http://csells.blot.im/public/post-images/13740-258.png


404s:
-need to provide URL pattern rewriting, e.g. /posts/details/<peramlink> => /<permalink>
 the following URLs need to be forwarded:
  /askthewonk => /writing/#qanda
  /colophon => /tagged/colophon
  /conference => /public/conference/index.htm
  /fun => /tagged/fun
  /interview => /tagged/interview
  /money => /tagged/money
  /tools => /tagged/tools
  /wahoo => /tagged/wahoo
  /tinysells/{code} => various (depends on the code)

-need to be able to see 404 errors and provide redirects to improve site over time
-would like to be able to provide a custom 404 page
+need to be able to optionally turn off auto-404 page and expose the 404 errors for tools to track (no need)


sorting:
+the sorting on the tagged pages is wrong (seemingly random), e.g. http://csells.blot.im/tagged/spout

pages:
+writing.html has "Page: yes" set, but is showing up as a blog post


Feature Requests:
-Google AdSense App: easily enabled for sidewall ads
-Twitter integration: integrate the blog posts and tweets into a single, unified feed


Markup processing on HTML files:
+1995\Jan-01-Initial-Launch-12641.html (and everything else):
  article title doesn't line up along the top with the date of the article for default template (it's wrapping the initial HTML comment in a <p>)
  need to be able to put Blot metadata into comments for HTML files so that it remains valid HTML

+1997\Jun-27-Welcome-to-MeowMoniker--12656.html:
  the embedded line endings are reflected in the output instead of being ignore as per HTML rules

+2000\Aug-08-DM-in-the-Wall-Street--12628.html:
  random formatting because of the intermitten blank lines that I don't begin to understand

+2001\Feb-16-Genghis-12427.html:
  the indents on the HTML is causing the HTML to be set as code like Markup instead of interpretted as HTML


metadata:
+Jun-27-Welcome-to-MeowMoniker--12656.html:
  I’ve specified the Date, Tags and Permalink metadata, but only the Date is used – the Tags and Permalink are ignored.


Apps:
+need to be able to provide custom disqus_url format to pull in existing Disqus comments
+turning off the automatic caption from the image alt text doesn't actually stop the captions from showing


Templates:
+Essay template home page shows 31 (?) of the most recent posts, but provides no paging UI to get to previous posts
