<h1>On becoming an empty nester...</h1>
<P>I submitted the final manuscript for <a href="/public/writing/wpfbook/">Programming WPF, 2nd edition, by Ian Griffiths and Chris Sells</A> to O'Reilly and Associates this morning for publication. Of course, there's stuff still to do (<A href="/1903">today we hit step 8&nbsp;of 18</A>), but this represents a major milestone in the life of any book.</P>
<P>I have mixed feelings when I finish a book. The last few have been especially intense, as I have a real day job on a Microsoft product-team-to-be, so it's just been evenings and weekends. With this much work to do, you have to focus hard and the work becomes a part of you. This means that giving it up is also hard. My boys are just now becoming teenagers, so it'll be a while yet before they leave home, but I imagine I'll feel the same kind of melancholy I feel now -- happy to see something you've put so much of your life into make its own way into the world, but hard to have the cord cut.</P>
<P>On average, I've been an author, co-author or a "with" on 12 books over the last 12 years. At one time, I had open contracts on four separate books. This book represents my last planned book. I'm now truly an empty nester.</P>
<P>So, what's next for me in this new phase of my life? Well, I've already started some stuff. A couple of weeks ago, I started a little gooey shell for monad (I call it "gonad"&nbsp; : ). And last Friday, I started private piano lessons (a blast!). I'd like to pick up my other hobbies again, too, but for the life of me, I can't remember what my other hobbies used to be...</P>
