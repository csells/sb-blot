<h1>CodeFetch: Search Book Source Code</h1>
<A href="http://www.codefetch.com/">CodeFetch</A> allows you to search in the source code associated with books (like the code I publish for my books). Plus, it lets you choose the language to search on and shows the book the results come from so you can read your favorites. Very cool.
