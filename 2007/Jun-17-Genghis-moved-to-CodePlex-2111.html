<h1>Genghis moved to CodePlex</h1>
<A href="http://adoguy.com">Shawn Wildermuth</A> has moved <A href="http://codeplex.com/genghis/">Genghis to CodePlex</A> because GotDotNet Workspaces is going away. I actually really like CodePlex, but not the state those pesky contractors left the Genghis bits in, so we'll be following up with another release in early July to bring sanity back. Thanks, Shawn!
