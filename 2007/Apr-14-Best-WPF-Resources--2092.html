<h1>Best WPF Resources?</h1>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Cambria>I&#8217;d like to provide a list of the best WPF resources, including real-world apps, free web resources, SDK docs, samples, blogs, etc. If you&#8217;ve got something that belongs on that list, I&#8217;d love to hear about it. Thanks!</FONT></P>
