<h1>Conversing In Italian over the Interweb</h1>
<P>Yesterday I got an email from a fellow named Corrado Cavalli to whom I sent a free copy of <A href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WPF-Chris-Sells/dp/0596510373/">Programming WPF</A>. When he received it and read through it, he posted <A href="http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/corrado/archive/2007/12/11/90228.aspx#feedback">a note on his web site</A>, which of course, I went to read.</P>
<P>Now, Corrado lives in San Pellegrino Terme, Bergamo Italy, so&nbsp;his blog is in Italian. That didn't stop me from reading it in English using <A href="http://translate.google.com/translate_t">Google's language translation page</A>.</P>
<P>Then, just to be "cheeky" as my Australian friends say, I composed simple responses in English and translated them to Italian before posting them, you know, pretending I'm smart and international and such like. : )</P>
<P>To be somewhat confident I wasn't asking him for improper knowledge of his dog, I did the Italian to English translation on the translated text and rearranged my English it bit when it wasn't quite right.</P>
<P>All in all, I'd say it worked out pretty well, although I did get some flowers from his dog the other day...</P>
