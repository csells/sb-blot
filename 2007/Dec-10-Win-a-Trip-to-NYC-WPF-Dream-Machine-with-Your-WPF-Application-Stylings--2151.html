<h1>Win a Trip to NYC + WPF Dream Machine with Your WPF Application Stylings!</h1>
<P>The nice folks at Lab 49 are throwing <A href="http://wpfcontest.lab49.com/index.aspx">a contest for WPF programmers</A>.</P>
<P>The goal: take the financial data they provide and build a kick-ass WPF app around it.</P>
<P>The grand prize:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a trip for two to the MS Financial Services Developer Conference in NYC</LI>
<LI>the "Ultimate WPF Developer's Machine"</LI>
<LI>an XBox 360 Elite (plus games!)</LI>
<LI>a Zune</LI>
<LI>a profile in WindowsFS magazine</LI>
<LI>a copy of Expression Studio, Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Vista Ultimate</LI>
<LI>a WPF Team signed t-shirt</LI>
<LI>&lt;whew&gt;!</LI></UL>
<P>Final submission is 2/29/08, but there are other prizes for early submission (by 2/14/08).</P>
<P>The judges (Charles Petzold, Rob Relyea, Josh Smith and yours truly)&nbsp;will be looking for "your use of WPF, innovative display of financial data, the quality of your code, performance, appearance, and overall functionality."</P>
<P>I'm a bit of a financial nut, so I'm very much looking forward to the results of this contest. Dazzle us!</P>
