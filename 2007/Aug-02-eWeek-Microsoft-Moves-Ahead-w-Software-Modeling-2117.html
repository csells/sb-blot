<h1>eWeek: Microsoft Moves Ahead w/ Software Modeling</h1>
<P>I work on the same team as Don and Chris to which <A href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2164677,00.asp">this article</A> refers. There's few actual facts in this piece and some of those are wrong (love Chris like a brother, but he wasn't on the WCF team : ), but it's interesting that my little group is making its way into the news.</P>
<P>BTW, as a matter of context, I'm not a big codegen fan (in spite of <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/GenProg/">my previous dealings</A> : ) and it would be a mistake to think of "modeling" as "fancy codegen," in spite of what this article implies.</P>
