<h1>Duck Typing for .NET!</h1>
For structural typing fans (and they'll be more of you over time -- trust me), David Meyer has posted <A href="http://www.deftflux.net/blog/page/Duck-Typing-Project.aspx">a duck typing library for .NET</A>. There are many reasons this is cool, but in summary, it allows for many of the dynamic features of languages like Python and Ruby to used used in any .NET language. Very cool.
