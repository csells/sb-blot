<h1>Shawn has prepared Genghis v0.8</h1>
<P><A href="http://adoguy.com/2007/08/24/Genghis_v0_8_Released.aspx">Shawn Wildermuth</A> has prepared <A href="http://codeplex.com/genghis">a v0.8 release of Genghis</A> that includes a bunch of stuff that the folks that put the v0.6 release together dropped. The v0.8 release has all the good stuff from the v0.5 release and all the new stuff from the v0.6 release in a .NET 2.0 package.</P>
<P>Shawn's really done all the work for Genghis since I came to Microsoft.&nbsp;Thanks, Shawn.</P>
