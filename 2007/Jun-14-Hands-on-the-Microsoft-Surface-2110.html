<h1>Hands on the Microsoft Surface</h1>
<P>After raving about <A href="/2104">Microsoft Surface</A>, I get a personal invitation from Robert Levy, a PM on the Surface SDK team to come take a look.&nbsp; Robert's job is to make sure it's possible for the partners that want to put a Surface into their hotels, stores and theme parks to build apps to help sell whatever they're selling.</P>
<P>There're currently no plans to enable just normal humans to program it, unfortunately, or even to sell the things except to corp partners. This is too bad, 'cuz I definitely want one for my family room. Man, talk about a conversation starter!</P>
<P>The demo apps were very cool. Of course, there were the apps that are shown on the surface web site and they really work. The ones that I thought were best were when you used physical devices to control what happens on the surface, e.g. turning a knob you drop onto the surface to adjust settings, putting a camera on the surface to get the pictures, putting a credit card on the surface to pay for your drinks, etc. Of course, just using your fingers to paint or drag stuff around was fun, too.</P>
<P>I can definitely see these things attracting a crowd at the zoo or the local phone store. It's a thing.</P>
