<h1>Windows Servers for the rest of us</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/bios/Detail.aspx?ID=218&amp;productID=P52R-1L-1&amp;pagesize=8&amp;pagination=true&amp;pageNumber=1">Charlie Kindel of COM fame</A> (he's wrote the foreword to Don's seminal work "Essential COM") is the Product Unit Manager (softie-speak for "butt on the line") for the new Windows Home Server team. If you haven't heard about it, Home Server is a Windows server box for the rest of us. I don't know about you, but I've got file, print and media servers all over the house in a confusing mess and I look forward to being able to consolidate it. According to the enthusiastic beta tester I talked to, Windows Home Server is the way to do that. </P>
<P>Yesterday, Charlie announced <A href="http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/">the Windows Home Server Blog</A>. Enjoy.</P>
