<h1>Free copies of "Programming WPF" for YOU!</h1>
<P>I just got a box full of free copies of <A HREF="/public/writing/wpfbook/">Programming WPF</A> from ORA.</P>
<P>If you want one, post a comment on this post with a) a reason why you deserve one and b) contact info so I can follow up for snail mail addresses.</P>
<P>That's it! I'll pick the top n folks based on how many books I've got when I unpack the boxes. : )</P>
