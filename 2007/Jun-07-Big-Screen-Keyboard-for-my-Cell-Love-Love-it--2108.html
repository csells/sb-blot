<h1>Big Screen + Keyboard for my Cell Love? Love it!</h1>
I love the idea of <A href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/mobilecompanion/">the new Palm Foleo</A>, i.e. my life fits on my cell phone in my pocket and my "laptop" is just a bigger display and full-sized keyboard. Of course, this presupposes the storage capacity to store my life on my cell phone (like I do currently on my laptop), which we're a ways from. Unfortunately, this means that the Foleo is likely ahead of its time and will therefore suffer, but it's another step down a good road (remember the "brick" computer that could plug into any keyboard/mouse?).
