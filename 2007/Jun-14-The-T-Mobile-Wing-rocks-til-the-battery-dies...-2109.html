<h1>The T-Mobile Wing rocks! 'til the battery dies...</h1>
<P>I was really loving my <A href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Detail.aspx?device=acc8102d-4506-4eaa-bc2f-9c7b8ec1b1e0">T-Mobile Wing</A>&nbsp;with WM6, Pocket Office, external micro-SD slot, slamming keyboard, beautiful ClearType display,&nbsp;one-handed usage (even though it is a PocketPC, I almost never needed to pull out the stylus), blue tooth (very high quality!), wi-fi, Edge and a slamming keyboard! (yes -- it was that slamming.).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, I couldn't keep it. After four days of the battery going dead after 12 short hours of my normal usage, e.g. email, texting, surfing, etc, it was dead. I turned off wi-fi, blue tooth and DirectPush to no avail. The T-Mobile Wing is just too cool for the battery and T-Mobile didn't have a bigger one to give me.</P>
<P>So it's back to my i-mate smartflip (hurray for data sync!). I was *so* loving that slamming keyboard...</P>
