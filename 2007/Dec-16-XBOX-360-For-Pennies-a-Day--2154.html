<h1>XBOX 360 For Pennies a Day!</h1>
<P>In 2006, I purchased an XBOX 360 bundle from CostCo for about $550, including the console, a game and two wireless controllers.</P>
<P>In April of 2007, my 360 caught the "red ring of death" ("Ring around the rosy, pockets full of posies, ashes, ashes, we all fall down!"), at which point I brought it back to CostCo and exchanged it for the bundle they had available at the time, which was $475. They refunded me the difference!</P>
<P>Net return: $75 in one year on an initial investment of $550.</P>
<P>Earlier this month, my new 360 also caught the plague and I returned it again to CostCo, where the holiday bundle now costs $400.</P>
<P>Net return: $75 in 7 months on an initial investment of $475 in 58% of the time from the last return of this amount.</P>
<P>If this continues, at this rate I'll have made my original investment back in another 9 months, at which point I'll have had the use of an XBOX 360 for 28 months for the opportunity cost of the original $550, which is approximately $50 at 7% over two years after taxes, $1.80/month or 6 cents/day.</P>
<P>What a deal! : )</P>
<P>P.S. The moral of the story: buy your electronics at CostCo.</P>
