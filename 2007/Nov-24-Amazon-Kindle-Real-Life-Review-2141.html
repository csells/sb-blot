<h1>Amazon Kindle Real-Life Review</h1>
<P>I've posted about ebooks before (e.g. <A href="/1944">I Hate Books</A>). <A href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/our-kindle-verdict/amazon-kindle-real+life-review-verdict-lightweight-long-lasting-and-easy-to-grip-in-bed-325939.php">It sounds like the Amazon Kindle has some real potential.</A> All we need is a product with enough critical mass to create a market and then we can have real competition ala the music player market.</P>
<P>Has anyone used an ebook reader before? I have some friends with the Sony version and they love it. Are we there yet? Does anyone have a Kindle?</P>
