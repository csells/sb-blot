<h1>The Potential of WPF/E</h1>
<P><A href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2007/02/01/9ea88d5c-c749-49f3-83aa-68505272dd4e.aspx">Savas</A> turned me onto an amazing WPF/E application. I don't speak the language of the web site, but <A href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2007/02/01/9ea88d5c-c749-49f3-83aa-68505272dd4e.aspx">the screenshot on Savas's site</A> is worth a look...</P>
<P>P.S. I don't smoke (except for the occasional cigar) and I definitely don't want to smell smoke while I eat or in my clothes, but the fact that smokers are no longer allowed to smoke most places strikes me as a violation of an important liberty. Have those studies about the effects of 3rd party smoke been verified?</P>
