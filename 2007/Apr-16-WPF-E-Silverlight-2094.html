<h1>WPF/E == Silverlight</h1>
<P>If you haven't already heard about <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/">Microsoft's new high fidelity, cross-platform application development platform</A>, you just haven't been paying attention. <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/">Silverlight</A> is the new name for WPF/E (although it's still XAML-based) and does some *amazing* things.</P>
<P>And, if you can wait just a little while longer, you can read about Silverlight in <A HREF="/public/writing/wpfbook/">Programming WPF</A> (available now <A href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510381/">in Rough Cut format</A> and for <A href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WPF-Chris-Sells/dp/0596510373/">pre-order from Amazon</A>) in an appendix by my friend and yours, <A href="http://www.adoguy.com/">Shawn Wildermuth</A>. Shawn's been doing a ton of Silverlight work lately, including doing a bunch of Silverlight presentations for Microsoft, so he knows of what he speaks.</P>
