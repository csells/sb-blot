<h1>Programming WPF, 2e (RTM Edition) on Amazon!</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WPF-Chris-Sells/dp/0596510373/">Buy your copy today!</A> : )</P>
<P>P.S. I read the QC1 (Quality Check 1), all 859 pages of it, in two solid days this weekend. I found a bunch of nits, all of which will be fixed before you see it in August. Wahoo!</P>
