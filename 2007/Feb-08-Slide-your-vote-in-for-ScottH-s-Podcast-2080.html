<h1>Slide your vote in for ScottH's Podcast</h1>
<P>I only listen to one podcast, so <A href="http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=18207#">casting my vote for Hanselminutes on podcast alley's list of top podcasts</A> was a no-brainer.</P>
<P>Plus, when I voted, they had a free sample for K-Y Brand Intrigue, which is apparently the longest lasting premium personal lubricant. The opportunity for jokes here is boundless, so let's start w/ some obvious ones and I'll send a free copy of Programming WPF to the best one in the comments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>I hesitate to think where the folks at podcast alley think we stow our MP3 players...</LI>
<LI>I like Scott, but come on...</LI>
<LI>What kind of gadgets has Scott been reviewing lately?!?</LI></UL>
<P>Enjoy. : )</P>
