<h1>"Programming WPF" (finally) shipping!</h1>
<P>John Osborn of O'Reilly and Associates had this to say in my morning email:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Congratulations, guys. </EM><A href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WPF-Chris-Sells/dp/0596510373/"><EM>The book</EM></A><EM> is printed and shipping! Just got my copy this morning and it looks great. A very substantial body of work, to say the least. </EM></P>
<P><EM>"Thanks for all of your hard work on this project. Now to crank up the PR machine and make sure no book shelf is without a copy."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Wahoo!</P>
