<h1>Releasing the Source Code for the .NET Framework Libraries!</h1>
<P>After programming with MFC (a lot!) and writing the ATL book, it was *very* difficult for me to live in a world without the source code to figure out how something was working. All of us have since moved over to <A href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Lutz's most excellent Reflector</A>, but that's still no substitute for actually stepping in and now ScottGu has announced that we'll have <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx">the ability to browse and debug with the .NET library source code, integrated into VS2008</A>:</P>

<P>Wahoo!</P>
