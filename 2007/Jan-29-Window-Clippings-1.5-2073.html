<h1>Window Clippings 1.5</h1>
<P>Capturing screenshots for a book used to be a piece of cake. Alt+PrintScreent and you were golden. However, sometimes I wanted to get the cursor, too, and neither Alt+PrintScreen nor PrintScreen does that, so I got myself a copy of <A href="http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.asp">SnagIt</A>. Unfortunately, if I wanted to capture multiple screens, I was putting a maximized copy of Notepad in the backgrand, using PrintScreen and PBrush to do the cropping (although SnagIt has slightly more seamless multi-window selection).</P>
<P>Still, this all worked 'til Vista came along and Alt+PrintScreen left the shadows out! I was fine with that, but <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian</A> correctly pointed out that the screenshots with the shadows looks *so* much better that I could hardly say "no." And I discovered the Snipping Tool in Vista, which let me do a selection on any part of the screen I wanted to, except that now instead of just doing Alt+PrintScreen, even for a single window, now everything is a selection, which means that somebody (hopefully not me!) has to trim the extra whitespace to make sure the pictures layout OK in the book.</P>
<P>I told you all of that so you could know that I envy folks that don't have to do screenshots! It's hard to make it look right, although, for visual technologies, I really can't imagine not having them. Anyway, I was definately open to another screen capturing technology and that's when someone turned me on to <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2007/01/28/window-clippings-1-5.aspx">Windows Clippings</A>.</P>
<P>When I found Kenny Kerr's most excellent screen capture tool, it was so close to what I wanted (it did Vista shadows with no guesswork!), that I sent Kenny an email with my feature request (easy child+parent capturing support), fully expecting not to hear back (it's clear from <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/">his web site</A> that he's a busy guy!). Not only did he reply, but he'd implemented my feature!</P>
<P>And it was such a time-saver, that I forwarded it along to Ian, who had his own feature request (keeping the transparency in the captured image w/o grabbing the stuff underneath), which Kenny promptly implemented (with some example code from Ian). Of course, that broke my feature (the constant animation of WPF apps + capturing transparency caused problems), so Kenny fixed that, too. By this point, Kenny's app itself was notifying me of updates faster than he could send the emails.</P>
<P>All of this is merely to say, I'm really loving my <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2007/01/28/window-clippings-1-5.aspx">Windows Clippings</A> experience. Thanks, Kenny!</P>
