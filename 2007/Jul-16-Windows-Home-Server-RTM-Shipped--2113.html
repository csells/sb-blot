<h1>Windows Home Server RTM Shipped!</h1>
I knew something was up when the Home Server team climbed onto a bus Friday afternoon outside of building 42. They were obviously celebrating something. This morning, I found out what it was -- <A href="http://blogs.technet.com/homeserver/archive/2007/07/16/ship-it.aspx">Windows Home Service RTM shipped</A>! Congrats, guys! I can't wait for the RTM bits to be available internally so I can install it. I've got a machine all picked out. : )
