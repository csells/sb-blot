<h1>MS Math Add-In for Word 2007</h1>
<P>I mention this because this is just the thing I've wanted to be able to check my kid's math homework: the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=030fae9c-704f-48ca-971d-56241aefc764">Microsoft Math Add-In for Word 2007</A>.</P>
<P>For example, after installing it, I can open Word, press Alt+= to get myself a new equation and then enter:</P>
<P>x^2 +2x + 2 + 3x - 4x^2</P>
<P>it translates into:</P>

<P>If I right-click and choose Simplify, I get the following:</P>
<P><IMG src="/public/spout/math2.jpg"></P>
<P>If I right-click again and choose Plot in 2D, I get:</P>

<P>If I've got an equation that I want to solve, I can enter it:</P>
<P><IMG src="/public/spout/math4.jpg"></P>
<P>and then right-click and choose Solve for x and get all the possible solutions:</P>

<P>This even works if you have multiple equations with multiple unknowns, which means this is good through at least 8th grade Algebra. Wahoo!</P>
