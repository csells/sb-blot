<h1>Shooting the Sh*t with Scott (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<P>Scott came over to my house and we made up a topic ("Software: The Last Fifteen Years and the Next Fifteen Years" in two parts), but it's really just an excuse to talk to each other and have a good ol' time. <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=78">Have a listen.</A></P>
<P>P.S. Sorry about coughing they weren't able to edit out. Alergies...</P>
