<h1>Programming WPF: Rough Cuts</h1>
If you can't wait for Programming WPF to be on the shelves (I know I'm having trouble), then you can <A href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510381/">read the chapters as we write them</A>. These chapters have not gone through the technical reviewing stage or the copy editing stage, but they've been through the baptism of fire that is co-author review and both Ian and I are nuts for grammar, so they should be pretty readable. Enjoy.
