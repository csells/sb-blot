<h1>The Future of Telecommuting</h1>
<P class=MsoNormal>I truly believe that the future of employment will be much more individualistic and that requiring people to move will be an anachronism. Right now, phone + LiveMeeting is about 50% as good as being there; you're limited in what jobs you can do based on how much a part of your job "being there" actually is. We already have the pieces of technology to push "being there" to about 80%; we just haven't put them together yet. When we do, a bunch more barriers are going to come down. Until then, some folks are on the bleeding edge and isn't that what this whole industry is about anyway? : )</P>
