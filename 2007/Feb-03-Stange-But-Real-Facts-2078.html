<h1>Stange But Real Facts</h1>
<P>I don't know how many of these are actually real (my left-handed son was very disappointed to hear that he'd be dying 9 years before his right-handed brother), but <A href="http://www.ratemyeverything.net/post.aspx?post=980">they were very fun to read with the kids</A>.</P>
