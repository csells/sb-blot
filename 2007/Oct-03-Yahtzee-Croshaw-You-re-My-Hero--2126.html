<h1>Yahtzee Croshaw -- You're My Hero!</h1>
<P>First it was <A href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/2304-Zero-Punctuation-Halo-3">the Halo 3 review</A> (which I can't agree or disagree with yet because I'm still stuck on level one) which a Wii zealot forwarded to me because he likes to send me links to negative portrayals of anything MS-related (like that's a challenge to find : ), then it was <A href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/1394-Zero-Punctuation-BioShock">the BioShock review</A> (a game I never figured out the cool part of), then&nbsp;<A href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/1383-Zero-Punctuation-Console-Rundown">his POV on the console wars</A> (I'm proudly a member of the frat-boy demographic!)&nbsp;and finally it was <A href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/1490-Zero-Punctuation-Tomb-Raider-Anniversary">the Tomb Raider Anniversary review</A> (a game I haven't played since v1 and preferred the Apple ][+ equivalent) which had me laughing out loud.</P>
<P>Agree with him or not, you gotta <A href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/profiles/view/Yahtzee%20Croshaw/posts">appreciate Yahtzee's style</A>.</P>
