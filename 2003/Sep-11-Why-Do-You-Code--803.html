<h1>Why Do You Code?</h1>
<a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/permalink.aspx/a2f88d4b-c9eb-40d4-a5af-dee8ffa161aa">Here</a>. I always enjoy Rory's writings. This time, he tells the stories of some amazingly dedicated coders and then asks the question "Why do you code?"

I think I started coding because I was such an anti-social geek that I needed something over which my actions had some reasonable, predictable outcome. Plus, I have that kind of a mind well-suited to programming. I continue to code as a way to a) learn how MS's latest technologies work and b) make my computer do what I want it to do. How about you?
