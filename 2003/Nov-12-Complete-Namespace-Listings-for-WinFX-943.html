<h1>Complete Namespace Listings for WinFX</h1>
<a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/avreference_entry.aspx">Here</a>. <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/ref/avreference_entry.aspx"></a>Check out the complete list (as of the PDC03) of the namespace listings on WinFX in the Longhorn SDK. Not only are old favorites listed, like System.Collections, but there are lots of new friends, like MSAvalon.*

Some of these namesspaces will change name and most of them will change in functionality before they ship, but there's just a treasure-trove of information in them (I'm all excited about digging into System.Speech.Synthesis myself...)

Enjoy.
