<h1>Comics via RSS?</h1>
<a href="http://www.comics.com">Here</a>. Has anyone built a comics.com to RSS gateway? I'd like to subscribe to my favorite comics w/o being forced to actually visit the site on a daily basis (I don't do that anymore [*]).

A dilbert.com to RSS gateway would be nice, too.
