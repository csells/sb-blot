<h1>Time For An Exciting Career In Electronics</h1>
<p><i>Monday, <span class="created">November 3, 
2003</span></i></p><p>Depending on how you look at it, what I'm best at in the whole 
world has either become completely unnecessary or incredibly easy. The skill 
that I spent most of the last 10 years learning was to look at a group of types, 
APIs, reference docs, headers, source code, etc., distill it down to a set of 
architectural intentions and then to weave a story through the whole thing to 
make sense of it for developers that weren't able to glean the intensions 
themselves (most often because they had real jobs). I call this exhaustive 
search for intention officially at an end. I'm no longer needed except as a 
gatherer for those not yet facile in RSS aggregators (which, luckily for me, is 
still a large number : ).</p><p>Blogs like <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">
Chris's</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott's</a> 
and <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/">Raymond's</a> 
go way beyond the &quot;what&quot; that docs and web sites and even mailing 
lists/newsgroups/web forums have typically stuck with and gone right into the 
&quot;why.&quot; And not only that, but Chris is actually taking that next step on his 
blog. In the old days, before my favorite technology company became so damn 
open, if I wanted to comment on something, I had to painstakingly track down the 
right people at Microsoft, make friends with them (which first demanded that I 
learn social skills) and then convince them that someone outside of MS might 
actually have something intelligent and useful to say. This often involved years 
of stalking 'softies in mailing lists and conference halls and now <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/commentview.aspx/b7e02709-0112-4977-9b73-1aa9d471a570">
Chris is letting anyone give him feedback to which he actually listens</a>!</p><p>
What use a hack like me that doesn't invent something, but merely figures out 
how existing things work so that I can tell someone about it if the guy that 
invents it does that part, too?!? I wonder if there are slots left in the 
vocational technical school near my house...</p>
