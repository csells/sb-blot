<h1>XmlSerializerPreCompiler</h1>
<a href="/12417">Here</a>. Tired of the XmlSerializer's generic "File or assembly name ctewkx4b.dll, or one of its dependencies, was not found" exception?

The XmlSerializerPreCompiler tools checks to see if a type can be serialized by the XmlSerializer class and if it can't, shows the compiler errors happening behind the scenes so that the type can be modified. Enjoy.
