<h1>Ingo says, "Sealed is Good"</h1>
<a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/Articles/SealedIsGood.html">Here</a>. He's right and he's wrong. He's right because "sealed" let the WinForms team build something more efficient w/o rebuilding all of the Win32 controls in managed code. He's wrong because the use of it stops me from deriving from ImageList (which I've wanted to do).

So, while sealed is useful, it still sucks. : )
