<h1>I don't know UIs, but I know what I like...</h1>
<p><i>Monday, <span class="created">November 24, 
2003</span></i></p><p>The user in me sees Longhorn and dreams of software without 
limits. The engineer in me sees Longhorn and is scared of software without 
limits. An engineer's days are defined by requirements and restrictions. Those 
restrictions come not only from the capabilities of the tools and technologies 
being bolted together, but also accepted practice. For years, I've been 
comfortable designing &quot;rich&quot; client applications because a) my tools and 
technologies haven't let me do much that was really &quot;rich&quot; and b) because &quot;rich&quot; 
was pre-defined by existing applications.</p><p>In fact, when I started 
programming Windows 3.1, I adopted a single 3-step UI design process:</p><ol><li>
	Figure out the the requirements of the particular UI doodad I needed</li><li>
	Find my favorite example of it in Visual Studio, Word or Outlook</li><li>
	Make User/MFC/WTL/WinForms do that</li></ol><p>It doesn't take much to 
design an application that looks like this:</p><img alt="" src="/public/spout/winforms01232003-fig01.gif" border="0" width="240" height="200"><p>
or even one that looks like this:</p><img alt="" src="/public/spout/winforms11202003-fig02.gif" border="0" width="345" height="228"><p>
when the process is merely aping existing apps. I was even encouraged to use 
this kind of UI design by books with color pictures from well respected authors:</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1893115941/joelonsoftware"><img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="140" alt="User Interface Design for Programmers" src="/public/spout/UI_For_Programmers.jpg" width="112" border="0"></a></p><p>
When the web came along, things were scary because all the guidelines were gone. 
However, at first the limitations were strict, so I didn't have any trouble 
building sites that looked like this:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.1.jpg" width="427" height="421"></p><p>
but when a few years later, the limitations faded away and I was expected to 
conceive of and implement stuff like this:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.3.jpg" width="462" height="623"></p><p>
I didn't have a clue. Luckily, the web &quot;way&quot; settled down over the years so that 
we figured out basically how to design web sites:</p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="1"><a href="http://www.sensible.com/buythebook.html"><img height="121" alt="Book cover: Don't Make Me Think!" hspace="10" src="http://www.sensible.com/DMMT%20cover%203d%20140h.jpg" width="92" border="0"></a></font></b></font></p><p>
Plus, limitations took hold as we realized that you could build pretty much 
anything you wanted unless you wanted it to work on someone's machine besides 
yours, which turned the screws down pretty tightly.</p><p>Still, while the 
emerging conventions helped me figure out what I wanted my own web site to look 
like in general, I had to *pay* for help from a otherly-skilled professional 
before I could get the specifics:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.9.jpg" width="496" height="475"></p><p>
This is where it got scary until I had the one application designed for which I 
would ever need a designer. With my web site out of the way, it was smooth 
sailing.</p><p>That is, until Longhorn and Avalon came along.</p><p>Avalon drops 
the bottom out of the limitations and the guidelines again, leaving guys like me 
in a lurch. Oh sure, I've done pretty much everything there is to do in this 
industry, from coder to President, from docs to QA, from project management to 
*shudder* marketing. However, what I haven't done and always hoped to avoid was 
design the graphics that go along with an application. Those were always things 
that I could hire done, most often as a deductible expense.</p><p>But now what 
do I do? MS doesn't provide MSDN authors a &quot;graphic artist&quot; budget. We do have 
very talented graphic artists at MSDN, but what's my boss going to say when 
they're swamped doing graphics for my pet projects and not the public-facing web 
site?</p><p>And standard bitmap graphic artifacts aren't enough; I need *vector* 
graphics. Even I can see that while this is fine:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.4.jpg" width="593" height="438"></p><p>
nobody is expanding sol.exe's main window to get more &quot;green space&quot;:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.8.jpg" width="593" height="438"></p><p>
To solve problems like these, we need vector graphics that look good when 
they're scaled, which I understand is roughly 10x harder than bitmaps (which are 
already beyond me).</p><p>But just the graphics aren't enough, either. MS is 
busy redesigning the Windows &quot;user experience&quot; to include the best of Windows 
and the web:</p><p><img alt="" src="/public/spout/apparchetypes2.gif" border="0" width="450" height="358"></p><p>
Apps are supposed to behavior sensibly (which I can handle) *and* look cool 
(where do I learn to make *that* happen?!?).</p><p>In fact, taking the next step 
from the budding UX guidelines, we seem to be heading into a place where if I 
want to build my own sol to fix the scaling, I'll be trying to fit a &quot;menu 
system&quot; on the front like the gaming guys do:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.6.jpg" width="367" height="242"></p><p>
and like so:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.7.jpg" width="384" height="259"></p><p>
In fact, I've heard tell that there's a special guy that designs these pre-game 
antics separately from the rest of the game just so folks think the game is cool 
as soon as it starts, long before you're actually playing it. How can I stand up 
to that kind of pressure? I was pretty damn happy with myself when I made blocks 
fall and stack:</p><p><a href="/public/wahoo/wahoo.exe"><img height="590" hspace="10" src="/public/spout/wahoo.JPG" width="281" border="0"></a></p><p>
And while this is the only scalable game of its kind of which I know (I was 
ready for Avalon a while ago, apparently : ), it still has the standard un-cool 
&quot;menu system&quot; that Windows comes with out of the box.</p><p>And there's no 
relief in sight! Avalon, by taking advantage of 3D hardware and displays that 
haven't even been invented yet, along with intrinsic support for every kind of 
media and animation that I'm familiar with, blows right by the limitations we've 
grown to know and love in Windows and web applications. Now we're into the world 
of game programmers, where if you can imagine it, you can do it.</p><p>But where 
am I going to get the graphics for what I can imagine?</p><p>How do I imagine a 
user experience when MS is literally still writing the book on it and they 
haven't shipped a Longhorn Visual Studio, Word *or* Outlook?</p><p>Graphic/user 
experience designers of the world, please be gentle; the engineers are spooked 
and could stampede at any moment...</p><p><a href="/967">
Know where I can get some graphics/user experience designers cheap?</a></p>
