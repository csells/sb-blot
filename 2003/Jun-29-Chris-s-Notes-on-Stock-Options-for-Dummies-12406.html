<h1>Chris's Notes on Stock Options for Dummies</h1>

		<p>Chris's Notes on
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/076455364X/chrissells">
		Stock Options For Dummies, Alan R. Simon, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2001</a>. 
		I recommend this book for folks that need to know the details of their 
		company's stock options, although the details aren't interesting enough 
		or important enough to warrant a book of this size, especially given how 
		worthless most company's stock options are these days.</p>
		<p>I bought this book when I was too stupid to recognize it as a book 
		about a company's stock options instead of about publicly traded 
		options. In general, the strategy that I've developed if I ever get the 
		opportunity to exercise company stock options is as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Exercise stock options as soon as possible, paying taxes as 
			appropriate</li>
			<li>Hold stocks for at least one year to reduce taxes on gains from 
			normal income tax rates, e.g. ~30%, to the long-term capital gain 
			tax rate, 15%, using 0 as the basis and subtracting the taxes 
			already paid in step 1</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Doesn't seem like enough for an entire book...</p>
