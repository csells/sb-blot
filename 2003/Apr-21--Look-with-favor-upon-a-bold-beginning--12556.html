<h1>"Look with favor upon a bold 
beginning"</h1>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I 
was having lunch with my wife at a little Chinese restaurant. My fortune was the 
title of this spout piece. I immediately associated it with <a href="/12392">
my recent job interview at Microsoft</a> and it made me smile. I had already 
pretty much decided to take the job, but it was nice that the Universe agreed 
with me. : )</p><p>Right now I'm sitting in NEO (New Employee Orientation) for 
Microsoft employees. Not only is it a cool name, but the nice folks at Microsoft 
provide a wireless network for new folks that can't spent hours w/o one 
(although I'm the only one that's geeky enough to have his laptop out at the 
moment : ). I start today as a Content Strategist on the MSDN content team at 
Microsoft, Corp. I'll be in charge of the Longhorn DevCenter. A DevCenter is a 
section of the MSDN web site that focuses on a specific technology area, like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml">
the XML/Web Services DevCenter</a>.</p><p>Longhorn is Microsoft's next major 
operation system (and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/">
different than Windows Server 2003</a>, which is the OS that Microsoft is 
launching this month). I can't (yet) say anything more about Longhorn except 
that it's cool enough that I took a job at MS so that I could get my hands on 
it. If you are dying for more info on Longhorn, but aren't quite ready to change 
your employment arrangements to get it, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/">
check out the PDC in October</a>. And, if you stop by and say &quot;hi,&quot; I'll show 
you the implant scars... : )</p>
