<h1>nogoop ActiveX/COM Inspector 1.1.10 released</h1>
<a href="http://www.nogoop.com">Here</a>. From Francis Upton: The ActiveX/COM Inspector allows you to inspect and execute any ActiveX control.  It works with controls and typelibs, automatically showing the documentation associated with classes and members.  Quickly find out how a control behaves using event logging, a visual design surface, method execution and property inspection.  Use it to help understand Automation interfaces (for example MS Office), and to help with developing Addins.
