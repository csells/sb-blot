<h1>My First PDC as a Microsoftie</h1>
<p>
After all the preparation, planning and sheer work, it's a letdown for the PDC 
to actually be over. It was an amazing experience for me to be &quot;back stage&quot; at a 
PDC, the only conference I'd spent my own money on for years (although as a 
speaker, they let me in gratis this year : ).</p><h2>Things I Heard:</h2><p>As a 
Microsoft employee, my job is to listen and take feedback home. Here's what I 
heard:</p><ul><li>Longhorn, Avalon/XAML, Indigo, WinFS, ClickOnce: <i>good</i></li><li>
	Improvements in VS.NET and ASP.NET: <i>good</i></li><li>Indigo and ClickOnce 
	on existing versions of Windows: <i>good</i></li><li>Avalon not available on 
	existing versions of Windows: <i>not so good</i><br>(Avalon changes things 
	all the way to the device driver level, so retrofitting it to existing 
	versions of Windows is impractical)</li><li>Not being able to download the 
	PDC Longhorn and VS.NET Whidbey bits: <i>not so good</i><br>(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/productinfo">MSDN 
	subscribers can request the CDs to be sent to them</a>)</li><li>Developers 
	that didn't go to the PDC and don't have MSDN subscriptions not getting PDC 
	bits: <i>not so good</i><br>(the public beta in the summer of 2004 will open 
	this up considerably)</li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/">
	The Longhorn Developer Center</a> features and content: <i>good</i><br>(whew 
	: )</li><li>Having all kinds of Microsofties at the PDC and on the 
	newsgroups and mailing lists to answer questions and take feedback: <i>good</i></li><li>
	Publicly contributed <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com">
	annotations on the Longhorn SDK</a> content: <i>good</i></li><li>Longhorn 
	bits running under Virtual PC: <i>good</i></li><li>Longhorn bits amazingly 
	functional and stable: <i>good</i></li><li>Longhorn bits not especially 
	speedy: <i>not so good</i><br>(these are the earliest OS bits we've ever 
	given to folks -- Longhorn will have <i>years </i>to improve in this and 
	every other regard)</li><li>Availability of PDC network, both wired and 
	wireless: <i>not so good</i><br>(don't know why this happened)</li><li>
	Stacking up outside the rooms of overflowing sessions: <i>not so good</i><br>
	(although MS attendees were very good about giving up their seats to paying 
	customers)</li><li>Microsoft's commitment to pushing managed code so far 
	into the OS: <i>good</i></li><li>Lots of folks interested in contributing to 
	the Longhorn developer community: <i>good<br></i>(if you're planning 
	something, <a href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=I Have A Contribution to the Longhorn Developer Community">
	please let me know</a>)</li></ul><h2>Things I Got To Do:</h2><p>Also, as a 
first timer backstage at the PDC (and a long-time member of the Windows 
developer community), I got to do all kinds of fun things:</p><ul><li>Give a 
	pre-conference tutorial on WinForms with Rocky Lhotka, a fellow giant 
	Minnesotan with whom I'd never before had a chance to work</li><li>Prepare 
	Sunday night to do the keynote demo in Chris Anderson's place on Monday 
	morning with Don Box and Jim Allchin in case Chris couldn't make it past the 
	fires in time</li><li>Hang out on the PDC keynote stage late at night, 
	soaking up the Chairman of the Board and Sr. VPs doing their last minute 
	preparations (and inadvertently making career-limiting statements : )</li><li>
	Watch Don and Chris and Jim pull off an amazing all-code keynote that will 
	go down in history as one of the PDC's best</li><li>Hang out at the Ask The 
	Experts session, coding up repros and solutions to WinForms questions 
	alongside Mark &quot;Mr. WinForms&quot; Boulter</li><li>Wandering the streets of 
	downtown LA with Frank Redmond looking for Tim Ewald's surprise birthday 
	party</li><li>Answer questions instead of ask them at the MSDN booth</li><li><a href="http://www.sys-con.com/dotnet/radio2003/interviews.cfm">
	Being</a><a href="http://www.sys-con.com/dotnet/radio2003/interviews.cfm"> 
	interviewed by Jon Box of Sys-Con Radio</a> and an old ATL student who 
	blames me for his career choices</li><li>Spent a lot of time telling people 
	about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developercenters">MSDN Developer 
	Centers</a>, where my friends at MSDN work very hard to pull information out 
	of the vast MSDN library and organize it for particular audiences, e.g. C#, 
	VB.NET, ASP.NET, Security, VS.NET, the .NET Framework, Architecture, etc.</li><li>
	Shake hands and sign autographs and have my picture taken with all kinds of 
	old friends and ex-students and readers and conference attendees</li><li>
	Gush like a fan-boy at Tim O'Reilly</li><li>Watch a block full of cars all 
	go backwards one night getting back into &quot;first positions&quot; (it was 
	California, after all : )</li><li>See the 4' high by 20' long WinFS schema 
	and realize just how much work the WinFS guys are actually doing to capture 
	&quot;Everyday Information&quot;</li><li>Send out the official welcome to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/">
	the WinFX newsgroups</a></li><li>Make tweaks to several potential keynote 
	demos at the last possible moment</li><li>Do an interview with .NET 
	Developer Journal that let me tell my side of all kinds of stories</li><li>
	Get all kinds of feedback from internal and external folks saying nice 
	things about the project that has consumed me for the last 6 months: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/">
	the Longhorn Developer Center</a></li><li>Go to a 1am show of <a href="http://www.wheaty.net/PDC2003/100_0079.jpg">
	The Metal Shop heavy metal &quot;mock 'n' roll&quot; band</a> at the Viper Room on the 
	strip in Hollywood with John Shewchuk and Matt Pietrek and screaming my 
	voice raw to the lyrics</li><li>Meet Sunny Day live and in person</li><li>
	Hang out with <a href="http://www.wheaty.net/PDC2003/100_0079.jpg">
	Matt Pietrek, one of my personal heroes</a>, along with <a href="http://www.wheaty.net/PDC2003/100_0039.jpg">
	Tim and Sarah</a> and most of my closest friends (where was <a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog2/">
	Craig</a>?!?)</li><li>Shake my tail feathers to <a href="http://www.wheaty.net/PDC2003/100_0045.jpg">
	yet another amazing Band on the Runtime gig</a></li><li>Attend all kinds of 
	technical sessions on the technologies of Longhorn so that I can continue to 
	live the Longhorn life for those developers that aren't yet able to</li><li>
	Start the collection of items for a Longhorn Developer FAQ which I'll post 
	when it reaches critical mass</li><li>Hang out with architects from two of 
	the three main pillars of Longhorn (Don Box, Indigo and Chris Anderson, 
	Avalon) at the The Kettle in Hermosa Beach</li><li>Share a room with the 
	19-year old .NET wunderkind, Ryan Dawson</li></ul><p>At this PDC, I 
definitely got to see how the sausage was made, but that still didn't take away 
from the deep, rich flavor. Recommend.</p>
