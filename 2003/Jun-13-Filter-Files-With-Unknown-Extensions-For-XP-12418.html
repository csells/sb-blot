<h1>Filter Files With Unknown Extensions For XP</h1>

	<p align="left">The fact that Windows XP Find in Files only searches files 
	with known file extensions drives me crazy because it skips, among other 
	things, .cs&nbsp; files. Every time I set up a new system, I have to 
	re-figure out how to fix this. To facilitate that, I put together
	<a href="/public/tools/FilterFilesWithUnknownExtensionsForXP.reg">a .reg file that will 
	search all unknown file extensions as text files</a>. Enjoy.</p>
