<h1>MS Trusted Most to Provide Security Systems</h1>
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/07/11/27FErrpcp_1.html?s=feature">Here</a>. "One of the most surprising results of the 2003 InfoWorld Security Survey is that more respondents trust Microsoft to deliver companywide enterprise OS security than they do any other vendor."

Nice to know folks trust us about *something*. : )
