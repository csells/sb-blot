<h1>Talking C#/CLR with Microsoft</h1>
<a href="http://www.codesta.com/knowledge/technical/csharp_clr/index.jsp">Here</a>. An interview of Peter Hallam, the dev. lead for the C# compiler. Most of the interview covers stuff you're likely to already know, e.g. the design goals for C# and the CLR, etc, but Mr. Hallam does spend some time talking about generics and his opinion on mono (he likes it).
