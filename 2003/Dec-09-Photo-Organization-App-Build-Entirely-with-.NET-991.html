<h1>Photo Organization App Build Entirely with .NET</h1>
<a href="http://photos.constanttime.com/">Here</a>. Of course, consumers won't care that the Electronic Showbox photo organization, editing and sharing software was built from the ground up using the .NET Framework (and <A href="http://www.genghisgroup.com">Genghis</A>), but I understand from the CTO that he "shudders" to think what it would have been link to develop in native code. Plus, he gives free copies to his favorite bloggers. Enjoy.
