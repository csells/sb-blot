<h1>Nice WinForms Reviews in the Blogesphere</h1>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321116208">Here</a>. I've noticed that lots of folks have nice things to say about "Windows Forms Programming in C#". I thank you and my publisher thanks you.

If you do post a review, you'll likely get an email from me asking you to post it on Amazon.com. That's because Amazon has noticed that it's the number of reviews of a product that determines whether something sells better than it's competitors, not the rating of the reviews (although feel free to say nice things... : ).

I'm posting this here to a) warn you that a review on my book is likely to get you an email from me and b) because Scott Galloway's Contact form is busted ("You must enter a search term"), so I needed *some* way to ask him to post his review on Amazon. Thanks!
