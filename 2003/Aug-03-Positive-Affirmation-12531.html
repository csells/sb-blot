<h1>Positive Affirmation</h1>
<p>I woke up at 
Don's house one day last week utterly convinced that I was going to win the 
lottery that day. It was 6:30a, which is early for me, but I had an 8a meeting 
(*very* early for Microsofties), so I had set the alarm. Tim, who was also 
staying at Don's that week and with whom I was sharing a room (separate beds : ) 
was on Eastern time, so had already accidently woken me at 6a that morning on 
his way to the door (it's not his fault; I'm too long for the bed and it's a 
tight squeeze to get past me when I'm I'm in it). I must've had some strong 
dream between 6a and 6:30a as I lay there in and out of sleep.</p><p>The 
premonition was so strong that I recalled the epilog from one of the first 
non-comic Dilbert books in which Scott Adams talked about his belief that there 
were multiple parallel universi and that by process of positive affirmations, 
he'd moved his consciousness into one that had attained great success in spite 
of his abysmal drawing abilities (this was before his TV series was canceled).</p><p>
So, all morning, in classic positive affirmation style, I had &quot;I will win the 
lottery today&quot; running through my head. It swamped all other thoughts, except 
those of whether I wanted the annual payment or the lump sum ($25M or $13M, 
respectively) and how I was going to spend the money.</p><p>My first purchase 
was to be a two-week trip for my entire extended family to Hawaii where we would 
decide how rest of the money was to be spent. The idea was to devise a plan 
wherein every adult member of my family could get a life-changing amount of 
money, e.g. $100K, to use to follow their dreams, but awarded only in a manner 
that wouldn't actually cause more harm than good (as large sums of money can do 
[or so I've heard...]). Then, I called my sister-in-law to ask her where, money 
being no object, she would want to live. I've been looking for houses in her 
neighborhood lately so that we could be closer (&quot;It takes a village to raise a 
child.&quot;).</p><p>Right away, she was suspicious of my question, &quot;Why? Are you 
going to win the lottery?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, confidently.</p><p>&quot;Really? How 
do you know?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I woke up with a 'feeling,'&quot; I said, unashamed.</p><p>&quot;How 
often have you had these feelings and they've come true?&quot; she asked, judging her 
odds.</p><p>&quot;Never.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, disappointedly.</p><p>&quot;No. I mean, 
I've never had a feeling like this before,&quot; I corrected her.</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she 
said, this time more excited. I've also loved that about my sister-in-law. She's 
very open-minded. She never once questioned my sanity (out loud), but instead 
started planning where she wanted to live. Her conclusion is that she'd want a 
nicer house very close to where she currently live, but basically, that was all. 
&quot;I like my life,&quot; she said.</p><p>That was my conclusion as well. I have things 
that I want to do that aren't likely to generate an income stream, e.g. <a href="/money">
figure out how money works</a>, but my life is a good one and doesn't need major 
changes. It was fun to go through the mental exercise and I would certainly have 
been happy to win the lottery that day, but it's OK that I didn't. That early 
morning feeling lead to positive affirmation of a different kind.</p>
