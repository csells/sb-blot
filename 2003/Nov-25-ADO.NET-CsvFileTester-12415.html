<h1>ADO.NET 
	CsvFileTester</h1>

    <img src="/public/tools/screenshot.jpg" width="580" height="322">
    <P><a href="/public/tools/CsvFileTest.zip">CsvFileTester</a> is a tool inspired by <A href="http://adoguy.com/content.aspx?id=answers/answer&amp;QID=53">
        Shawn Wildermuth's ExcelFileTester</A>, which he wrote 'cuz I kept asking him 
      how to do queries on .xls files. However, because the Excel query language has 
      no where or order by clauses, I gave that up in favor of comma-separated text 
      files.</P>
    <P>I wrote CsvFileTester (with Shawn's help) to explore the ADO.NET/ODBC/JET 
      support for CSV files and I was amazed at how comprehensive the support was. 
      And, since I can never remember the syntax and limitations between one use of 
      Jet expression syntax and the next, I put a bunch of samples in the combobox.</P>
	<P>Enjoy.</P>
