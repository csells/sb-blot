<h1>SYS-CON RADIO @ the PDC</h1>
<a href="http://www.sys-con.com/dotnet/radio2003/interviews.cfm">Here</a>. SYS-CON interviewed me and a bunch of my friends at the PDC. It's somewhat painful to listen to me with a cold, but fun to listen to folks like Dan Appleman, Scott Hanselman, Chris Kinsman, Jeff Prosise, Ingo Rammer, Brent Rector, John Robbins, David Treadwell, Shawn Wildermuth and a whole bunch more.
