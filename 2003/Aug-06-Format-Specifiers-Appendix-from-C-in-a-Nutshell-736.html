<h1>Format Specifiers Appendix from C# in a Nutshell</h1>
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csharpnut/chapter/appb.pdf">Here</a>. By request, O'Reilly and Assoc. has posted the Format Specifiers appendix from C# in a Nutshell by Drayton et al. It's a wonderful reference to the String.Format/ToString format specifiers that I'm constantly searching for on MSDN. Thanks, ORA!
