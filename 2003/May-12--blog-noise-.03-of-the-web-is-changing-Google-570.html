<h1>"blog noise?!" .03% of the web is changing Google</h1>
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/30621.html">Here</a>. Apparently, 0.03% of the web is made up of blogs, but that's still enough to change Google's basic assumptions:

"They presumed that technicians at USC would link to the best papers from MIT, to the best local sites from a land trust or a river study - rather than a clique, a small group of people writing about each other constantly. They obviously bump the rankings system in a way for which it wasn't prepared."

Because of this, Google is likely to set up a "Blog" tab and take blog results out of the main searches. I'm on the fence as to whether the latter is a good thing, but it's nice to know that something grassroots like blogs can still change the world.
