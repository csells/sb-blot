<h1>Paul Thurrott Previews PDC Longhorn Thoroughly</h1>
<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/longhorn_4051.asp">Here</a>. Paul Thurrot digs deeply into the PDC build of Longhorn, including impressions, screen shots and videos. Of course, since this is a developer release, the user experience isn't nearly what we plan it to be, but even developers need to know how to use the OS for which they're developing. : )
