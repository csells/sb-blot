<h1>New Longhorn Site for Academics</h1>
<a href="http://www.academiclonghorn.com/">Here</a>. "There are many sites on the web related to Longhorn already, but none that are geared towards academia. In fact, the most common sites like LonghornBlogs.com are made up largely of Microsoft employees. We think that an independent site where users can share their knowledge but also opinion will go a long way towards making Longhorn a better product for everyone!"

LonghornBlogs.com is for anyone, but a site for academics interested in Longhorn is a good thing, too. Welcome!
