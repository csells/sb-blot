<h1>Updated XsdClassesGen for VS.NET 2003</h1>
<a href="/12422">Here</a>. I've updated XsdClassesGen for VS.NET 2003. For those of you unfamiliar with it (it's never been as popular as CollectionGen for some reason), XsdClassesGen is a VS.NET Custom Tool that generates C# or VB.NET wrapper class source code from an XSD. It's just like running xsd.exe from the command line, but integrated into VS.NET (which is where all tools belong, afaic).
