<h1>Let The Language Wars Continue</h1>
<p>A friend of mine pointed out to me the other day that the 
C in CLR stood for &quot;Common,&quot; that is, the CLR provides the same services to all 
languages. In fact, at this date, C# and VB.NET are really just &quot;skins&quot; over the 
CLR and provide nearly identical functionality. With that in mind, why are we 
still fighting the language wars? There are several reasons:</p><ul><li>VB and 
	C# programmers are just culturally different. They come from different 
	backgrounds, different educations and different points of view. Remember 
	that VB was initially invented to let non-programmers program. C++ 
	programmers came from folks building operating systems. Those roots are 
	still evident today.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The VB and C# product teams are 
	different and gain benefits based on how many of each kind of programmer 
	there are. Based on that, do you think that those teams are going to pound 
	the &quot;all languages work great under the CLR&quot; or the &quot;C#/C++/VB.NET rocks&quot; 
	drum? Which message makes you look best at review-time?<br>&nbsp;</li><li>
	Languages *should* be different. Managed C++ does that cool managed 
	code/unmanaged types thing. Eiffel# does Design by Contract. Perl.NET has 
	obfuscation built in at the source code level, alleviating the need for a 
	3rd party tool. The fact that VB and C# are virtual clones of each other is 
	a mistake that I hope is rectified. Frankly, I hope that VB goes back to 
	it's roots of enabling non-programmers, as that's a huge hole in the current 
	list of managed languages. Certainly C# is going back to its roots by adding 
	generics et al in the next version.</li></ul><p>I've found that the &quot;Common&quot; 
means that teams can use the same language at more levels of their system, i.e. 
no more VB for this, C++ for that, script for this other thing. Now it can be 
all VB or all C# (or almost all, 'til Yukon ships) and the number of different 
kinds of programmers needed for a single project goes down. That provides a real 
benefit to companies trying to keep costs down and quality up while still 
allowing the team to decide what language features are important to them. This 
is goodness.</p><p>With the increased shared capability at the runtime level, 
I'm actually hoping that language motivation will increase. I think that there's 
still a lot left to do to make the programmers more productive and the 
motivation for one language to gain ground over another is a good thing. Plus, I 
still have an excuse to make fun of semi-colon-challenged programmers and what 
could be better than that? : )</p>
