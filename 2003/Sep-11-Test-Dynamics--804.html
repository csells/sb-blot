<h1>Test Dynamics </h1>
<a href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/2003/09/10.html#a353">Here</a>. Not quite knowing where Josh was going, I really liked it when he said, "... with the advent of managed code, our devs are somewhere close to twice as productive as before..."

However, with the end of that same sentence, he sent chills down my spine, "... this means that one dev can overwhelm a tester pretty quickly."

He goes on to wonder whether, because managed code has fewer bugs, we'll be able to keep going or have to increase the number of testers. The thing that scares me is that testers are a rare breed, hard to find and hard to keep, especially as many of them want to cut their own code, not report bugs on someone else's.

Is the next growth industry in the IT industry testers? Is the next DevelopMentor an out-sourced QA company?
