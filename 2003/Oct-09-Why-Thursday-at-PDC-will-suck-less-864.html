<h1>Why Thursday at PDC will suck less</h1>
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/jmazner/PermaLink.aspx/c74b726c-f19f-4d69-91c6-3070be03327a">Here</a>. This year's PDC will turn the traditionally most boring day into potentially the most interesting. Jeremy Mazner's posted the list of panels we're having that day as well as a place for folks to seed the MCs of the panels with questions they'd like to have asked of the panelists. Should be fun!
