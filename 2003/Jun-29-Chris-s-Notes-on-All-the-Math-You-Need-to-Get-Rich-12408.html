<h1>Chris's Notes on All the Math You Need to Get Rich</h1>

		<p>Chris's Notes on
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812694473/chrissells">
		All the Math You Need to Get Rich: Thinking with Numbers for Financial 
		Success, Robert L. Hershey, Open Court Pub Co, 2001</a>. I recommend 
		this book for the basics it covers, the slim size, the exercises and the 
		approachable text.</p>
		<p>I graduated from high school with all kinds of wonderful math grades 
		(I finished all of my high school math a year early and had to attend a 
		calculus course at a nearby college in my senior year), but managed to 
		get out without a firm grasp of some simple ideas. Specifically, I never 
		learned why it is that when I make a fixed house payment, the actual 
		amount that goes to the interest and to the principle varies each month. 
		The reason this is (as I'm sure all of my readers already know) is 
		because the interest is only paid against the outstanding principle that 
		remains on the total loan each month. It's just like compound interest 
		in reverse (an idea that I always did understand).</p>
		<p>I haven't been reading this book cover to cover (I already know how 
		fractions, scientific notation and fractions work), but this one fact 
		alone makes this book worth the price. Plus, it makes a wonderful 
		reference (this is where I got F=P(1+R)^N used in
		<a href="#The_Average_Return_Myth">The &quot;Average Return&quot; Myth</a>). The 
		world needs more short, focused, well-written books.</p>
