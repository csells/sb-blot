<h1>An entire site dedicated to connection strings!</h1>
<a href="http://www.connectionstrings.com/">Here</a>. "The idea of connectionstrings.com is to provide an easy reference for connectionstrings. All connection string and enumeration info are collected from other internet sites, books, helpfiles, Microsoft msdn, etc."

Holy cow! An entire site of just connection string examples! Cool!
