<h1>Linus Torvald Goes To Work in My Neck Of the Woods</h1>
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news/mailprint.php3?action=pv&ltsn=2003-06-17-014-26-NW-KN-DV">Here</a>. I continue to live in Beaverton, OR, but work for a company further north.

Linus continues to live in California, but works for a company in Beaverton, OR.

I don't know what that means, but it sounds cool. : )
