<h1>Learn the new VC++ from the master</h1>
<P>I used to brag that, unlike most C++ programmers, I learned C++ directly from the CFRONT 2.0 release notes and not from Stanley Lippman (his <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201824701/chrissells">C++ Primer</A> is a key part of C++ canon law). That boast came to a screeching halt when I had Stan in one of my COM courses and he revealed that he'd written the CFRONT 2.0 release notes.</P>
<P>And as if teaching the world C++ wasn't enough, now that he works at Microsoft on the new Visual C++ and it's new support for the .NET Framework in "Whidbey," he's started <A href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/slippman/">a blog to teach the world now only how VC++'s new tracking handle syntax (aka "hat") but more importantly to point out *why* the VC++ went in this new direction</A>.</P>
<P>And I can't imagine someone I'd rather learn it from.</P>
