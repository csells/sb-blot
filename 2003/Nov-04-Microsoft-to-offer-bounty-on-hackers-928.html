<h1>Microsoft to offer bounty on hackers</h1>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/989410.asp">Here</a>. "Microsoft will announce on Wednesday that it will offer two $250,000 bounties for information leading to the arrest of the people who released the MSBlast worm and the SoBig virus, CNET News.com has learned."

Holy cow! Did Microsoft just create a new profession: the cyber bounty hunter?!?
