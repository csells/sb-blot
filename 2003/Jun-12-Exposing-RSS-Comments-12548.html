<h1>Exposing RSS 
Comments</h1>
<p>So far, comments have gotten 
a lot of play in the RSS space:</p><ul><li>The <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss2#comments">
	RSS 2.0 &lt;comments&gt; element</a> to expose a link for a browser-based UI to 
	view/add comments</li><li>The <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/files/Modules/Proposed/mod_slash.html#model">
	&lt;slash:comments&gt; extension</a> element to expose the number of comments 
	current made on an item</li><li>The <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9">
	&lt;wfw:comment&gt; extension</a> element to expose the URL endpoint for posting 
	comments via <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9">the 
	CommentAPI</a></li></ul><p>However, what's missing is the ability to pull 
out a list of comments associated with an item. Instead, <a href="http://intertwingly.net/rss/">
folks like Sam publish their comments as a separate feed</a>, and then <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/rssbandit_slashdot2.gif">
feed readers thread the comments with the content</a> by comparing the elements 
from the type feeds (as well as all of the other feeds). That works for most 
standard-sized RSS sites, but what about sites that exposes hundreds of 
thousands of entries like msdn.com? Cached per site comment feeds don't scale as 
well as on-demand per-item comment feeds. Towards that end, I'd like to propose 
another element to <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/story/9">
the well-formed web's CommentAPI namespace</a>: commentRss.</p><p>The commentRss 
element would be a per-item URL for an RSS feed of comments. It looks very like 
the wfw:comment element:</p>
<pre>&lt;wfw:commentRss<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:fuchsia"> </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:maroon">xmlns</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:fuchsia">:</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:red">wfw</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;color:blue">=&quot;http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/&quot;&gt;</span>&nbsp;
  http://bitworking.org/news/commentsRss/52
&lt;/wfw:commentRss&gt;</pre><p>With wfw:commentRss, the RSS reader can pull the 
comments down on demand, merging them in with the cross-references from other 
blogs as it does now. In addition, an extension to RSS like this would allow 
feed readers to subscribe to comments for a particular item, either manually for 
conversations in which the user is interested or automatically when the user 
posted a comment for an item.</p><p><a href="/12548">
Comments?</a></p>
