<h1>The Longhorn SDK Online</h1>
<a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/">Here</a>. If you haven't seen it yet, or weren't able to get the CDs from the PDC, you'll want to check out the online Longhorn SDK.

Even if you do have the offline LHSDK, you'll want to check out the online version, as it includes experimental support for MSDN Annotations, which lets readers comment on each page.
