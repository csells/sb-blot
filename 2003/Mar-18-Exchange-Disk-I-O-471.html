<h1>Exchange Disk I/O</h1>
<a href="http://www.only4gurus.com/v2/download.asp?ID=776">Here</a>. From Michael Box: Since its release in 1996, Microsoft Exchange has depended upon the I/O subsystem for its high performance and availability. While the storage industry progresses significantly with innovative solutions, there are key concepts you must understand if you want a successful and durable Exchange server deployment. Windows .NET, performance, backup techniques, and technology reviews such as Storage Area Networks and Network Attached Storage, are the main aspects of this session. With more than six years of experience in this field, the presenters put these aspects into the perspective of Exchange 2000's own requirements and dependencies. This is essential for IT administrators and decision makers to make the right choices and investments for their Exchange rollout!
