<h1>WinFX: An All-Managed API by Ian Griffiths</h1>
<a href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/11/24/longhorn_01.htm">Here</a>. I can't believe a missed the first piece of Ian Griffiths's new column! Ian is a DevelopMentor instructor, co-author on three books with me (two still in development) and a long-time friend. Check out his opinion&nbsp;on WinFX and what it means for&nbsp;developers and please&nbsp;point me at the RSS feed so I don't miss the next one!
