<h1>Applied XML Dev.Conf. Talks Coming In</h1>
<a href="/conference">Here</a>. Today is the deadline for the Applied XML Developers's Conference and almost half of the slides are in already. I like to leave things 'til the last minute so that the conference always has the speakers freshest thinking.

Of course, one of the perks of running a conference is that you get a peak at things early. These talks look really fun. Can't wait to see them presented.
