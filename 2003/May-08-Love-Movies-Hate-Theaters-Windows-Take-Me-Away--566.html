<h1>Love Movies; Hate Theaters; Windows, Take Me Away!</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/drm.aspx">Here</a>. The last time I saw a movie, it occurred to me that as much as I love them, I hate theaters. They overcharge for the tickets and then require your first born child for popcorn and sodas. Movie theaters make airports seem like dollar stores.

Anyway, I've got a great setup at home, complete with big screen TV, 5.1 digital surround sound and a PC already connected to the whole mess. I'm a big NetFlix.com fan, but they and sites like CinemaNow.com only show stuff that's available for rental. I want first run movies!

Shouldn't a platform with such a strong media and digital rights management story allow me to watch first run movies at my house? And wouldn't that be a killer app for a new OS from that company?

DISCLAIMER: I'm not pre-announcing anything. I don't know of any plans along these lines; I just think it'd be cool.
