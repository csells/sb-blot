<h1>Aspect-Oriented Programming with C# and .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/dcl/papers/isorc2002.pdf">Here</a>. From Hun Boon Teo: A research paper from two German scholars, part of the abstract: "Within this paper, we discuss the usage of aspectoriented programming techniques in context of the .NET framework. We focus on the fault-tolerance aspect and discuss the expression of non-functional component properties (aspects) as C# custom attributes. Our approach uses reflection to generate replicated objects based on settings of a special “fault-tolerance” attribute for C# components."
