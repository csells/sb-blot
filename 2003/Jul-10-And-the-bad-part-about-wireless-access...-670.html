<h1>And the bad part about wireless access...</h1>
While it's cool that we have bits and electrons at this year's Developer's Conference, unfortunately the speaker has to compete with the entire web during their talk. This means that if you're less than completely riveting (which few speakers are), folks check out and often can't catch up. It's hard enough to give a good talk, but that's just brutal.
