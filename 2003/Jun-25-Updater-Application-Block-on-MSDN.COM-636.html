<h1>Updater Application Block on MSDN.COM</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/updater.asp">Here</a>. Jamie Cool's App Updater sample that keeps an installed WinForms application up to date with bits from a server has been updated and is now available as the Updater Application Block to be even more robust (although Jamie's sample code was used for all of the Terrarium code updates, which had huge usage). Recommended.
