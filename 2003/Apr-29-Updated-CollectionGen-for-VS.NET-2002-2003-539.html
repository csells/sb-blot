<h1>Updated CollectionGen for VS.NET 2002 & 2003</h1>
<a href="/12424">Here</a>. I've updated CollectionGen with code to support both VS.NET 2002 & 2003. It has no dependencies on any VS.NET design-time DLLs, so one binary works for both versions. If you're building custom tools, this should form a good base to support both environments.
