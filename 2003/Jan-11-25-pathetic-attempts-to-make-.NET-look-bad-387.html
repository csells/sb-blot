<h1>25 pathetic attempts to make .NET look bad</h1>
<a href="http://staff.develop.com/jasonw/weblog/2003/01/11.html">Here</a>. I just like to read JasonW, but this one was particularly nice. He refutes some pretty wild claims from one member of the Java community.

Along these same lines, I spent a day of onsite consulting having a .NET vs. Java debate. I was the outsider .NET guy and the company already had three Java guys already on staff (one was the VP of Engineering). Needless to say, .NET won. : )  It boiled down to what to do with the existing ATL/COM/C++ code base and the .NET interop story wins there hands down.
