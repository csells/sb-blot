<h1>A Sneak Preview of Visual C# Whidbey</h1>
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/d/2/2d2b339a-95b9-4f0e-a761-3c62c043ff5d/CSharpSneakPreview.doc">Here</a>. While things will most definately change before VS.NET Whidbey is released, this document provides a great list of new features in both C# Whidbey and VC# Whidbey. And it's much more than generics, partial types, anonymous methods and iterators.
