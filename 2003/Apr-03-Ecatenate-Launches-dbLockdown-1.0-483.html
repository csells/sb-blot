<h1>Ecatenate Launches dbLockdown 1.0</h1>
<a href="http://www.ecatenate.com/dblockdown_product_info.html">Here</a>. From Simon Train: Ecatenate dbLockdown 1.0 is a database tool to protect SQL Server and MSDE databases. The tool encrypts stored procedures, triggers, user defined functions and views, stopping anyone from viewing or editing them. Database scripts encrypted are automatically archived and can be restored at any time. dbLockdown uses SQL Server's native encryption and therefore does not compromise the functionality of database scripts. The tool is ideal for administrators and developers who need to lockdown production databases or databases shipped with products.
