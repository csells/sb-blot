<h1>Lending a Helping Hand</h1>
<p>I know 
this sounds like spam, but it's not -- it's from my Uncle Mark, who's also my 
godfather and the nicest man I've even known:</p><blockquote>Chris, I'm writing 
	you to ask your help. My brother Tom was gravely ill. Tom is 55 years old, 
	married with two grown sons. He needed both a liver and a kidney transplant. 
	He just received his transplants. It was by the grace of God just in time as 
	he was within 2 to 3 days of death. He is doing well with no signs of 
	rejection and just some minor complications. Unfortunately, he is nearly 
	bankrupt from all his medical bills. Tom's life has been marked by several 
	challenges, many overcome through hard work and determination. He is a man 
	of immense spirit and we all love him dearly. This is a challenge he can't 
	face alone. As you can imagine, our family is very concerned. We pray a lot. 
	We have also undertaken a benefit and raffles for him to help him with his 
	expenses. Right now we're just trying to help him pay his mortgage and put 
	food on his table. He hasn't been able to work for three months. He also 
	faces a tremendous bill from the transplant that his health insurance won't 
	pay.<br><br>There are five courses of action I'd like you to consider. First 
	of course is <b>I'd appreciate your prayers for my brother</b> Tom that he 
	continue to recover his health and his finances. The next four things I am 
	asking for is your support of our raffles and benefit.<br><br>I would like 
	you to <b>consider purchasing a ticket for what we call the &quot;Big Money 
	Raffle&quot;</b>. There will be a limit of 110 tickets sold. First prize is 
	$2000. Second prize is $1250. Third prize is $750. There will be an 
	additional ten $100 winners. Odds of winning some prize are 13 in 110. 3 in 
	110 chance of bettering your bet. 1 in 110 of winning the top prize. Tickets 
	cost $135 apiece. Much better odds than the lottery. Drawing 1/11/04.<br><br>
	Also available are <b>Quilt tickets at $1 apiece</b>. My sister made the 
	Queen size quilt. Value is somewhere between $1000 and $1500. Drawing 
	1/11/04.<br><br>The third thing I'd like you to consider is if you know 
	anyone among <b>your connections in the computer world who might also like 
	the opportunity to purchase &quot;Big Money&quot; and &quot;Quilt&quot; raffle tickets</b>. I 
	know you know a lot of people and some of them might be generous of spirit 
	and/or gamblers. I think this time of year people yearn to be of help and 
	service but aren't often sure what they can do. <a href="mailto:emkayen@aol.com?subject=TOM NEEDHAM LIVER TRANSPLANT FUND">
	This is one such opportunity.</a><br><br>The fourth thing I'd like you to 
	consider is helping with the benefit dinner. It will be January 11th. There 
	will be a silent auction. I thought with your connections at Microsoft you 
	might be able to get them to <b>donate something for the silent auction </b>
	like some software or ?. Mr. Gates has such a wonderful legacy of 
	philanthropy and I'm hoping that may reach down the organization for 
	individuals in need.<br><br>Thank you Chris for your consideration. If all 
	you can offer is your prayers I will understand and greatly appreciate them. 
	If you or anyone you pass this on to wish to purchase tickets, <b>checks can 
	be made out to &quot;TOM NEEDHAM LIVER TRANSPLANT FUND&quot;. Anyone wishing more 
	details can contact me, Mark Needham at 952-226-1769 or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:emkayen@aol.com?subject=TOM NEEDHAM LIVER TRANSPLANT FUND">
	emkayen@aol.com</a></b>. I will be happy to fill out the tickets and return 
	the stubs to them. The information needed is name, address &amp; phone number 
	for both the Big Money and Quilt raffles. The Minnesota lawful gambling 
	exempt permit # is X-34753-04-001.</blockquote><p>While I don't know my 
uncle's brother (his part of the family never really mixed with mine for some 
reason), because it's important to my uncle, I'll be purchasing one of each of 
the two kinds of raffle tickets, publicizing my uncle's plea on my web site, 
investigating Microsoft's matching for charity and, of course, sending my 
prayers. If any of you is interested in <a href="mailto:emkayen@aol.com?subject=TOM NEEDHAM LIVER TRANSPLANT FUND">
participating in the raffles, let Mark know directly</a>. If you wanted to 
publicize this on your own web sites or donate something for the silent auction, <a href="mailto:emkayen@aol.com?subject=TOM NEEDHAM LIVER TRANSPLANT FUND">
let Mark know about that</a>, too. Of course, all prayers are warming accepted.</p><p>
Thank you very much and have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
