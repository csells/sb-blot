<h1>Microsoft Gets a Clue From Its Kiddie Corps</h1>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/873455.asp">Here</a>. A bunch of kids gather in a real-world like setting to design an app, only consulting an actual software engineer after the spec is done. Not only does the core app sound cool, i.e. groups of contacts that play/chat together in an online environment, but the way they designed it sounds cool, too. I'd like to grab a set of my customer base and hang in a trendy Seattle downtown warehouse for a month, too, but my customers are all too old to get away for that long. : )
