<h1>Another C# Refactoring Tool</h1>
<a href="http://dotnetrefactoring.com/">Here</a>. A VS.NET add-in that provides the following C# refactoring operations:

-Encapsulate Field 
-Extract Method 
-Inline Temp 
-Introduce Explaining Variable 
-Move Method new 
-Rename Field 
-Rename Method 
-Rename Property 
-Rename Local Variable 
-Rename Parameter 
-Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant 
-Replace Temp with Query 

It seems to be implemented in Java and then ported to .NET via J# and the web site has the coolest little visitor counter control.
