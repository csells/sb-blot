<h1>Saving Your Career</h1>
<p><i>
<span class="created">Friday, Feb 7, 2003</span></i></p><p>In response to <a href="/12574">Never 
Send An Email In Anger</a>, Lars Bergstrom recommended that I set up a rule that 
defers sending an email for 1 minute. I set it for 2 minutes under Outlook XP 
like so:</p><ul><li>Tools-&gt;Rules Wizard</li><li>New</li><li>Start From A Blank 
	Rule</li><li>Check messages after sending</li><li>Which condition(s) do you 
	want to check? -&gt; None</li><li>This rule will be applied to every message 
	you send. Is this correct? -&gt; Yes</li><li>What do you want to do with this 
	message? -&gt; defer delivery by a number of minutes</li><li>a number of 
	minutes -&gt; 2</li><li>Finish</li></ul><p>And it works like a charm. It's 
always w/in the first second that I wish I could recall a message, so two 
minutes should be more than enough. Wahoo!</p>
