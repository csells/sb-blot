<h1>Chris's Notes on The Motley Fool Investment Guide</h1>

		<p>Chris's Notes on
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743201736/chrissells">
		The Motley Fool Investment Guide: How The Fool Beats Wall Streets Wise 
		Men And How You Can Too, David Gardner, Tom Gardner, Fireside, 1997</a>. 
		I don't recommend this book for anything but an example of the hubris 
		that was rampant during the Internet bubble and a few chapters that hold 
		the reader's hand making the markets seem approachable.</p>
		<p>In general, I recommend
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684811634/chrissells">
		Peter Lynch's Learn to Earn</a> for the hand holding instead.</p>
