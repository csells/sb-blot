<h1>Communication Is All</h1>
<p>It's 
amazing to me the&nbsp; number of problems that can be solved or avoided 
completely with communication. For example, the prevailing attitude of the day 
is that children should not be let out of an adult's sight, in spite of an 
all-time low in the history of violent crime. Towards that end, and since 
tomorrow is the first day of school, my oldest boy is currently testing the 
range of our walkie-talkies to see if he and his younger brother can walk to 
school. The reason? Because I can communicate with him to know that they got to 
school OK. I need that communication so that I can continue to be paranoid while 
still letting him walk the half-mile to school.</p><p>Here's another example: 
Recently at work there was a minor fracas when group A published their planned 
work based on group B's input aka *implicit* buy-in, but without group B's 
*explicit* buy-in. This made group B unhappy, because they felt that their input 
wasn't been taken (even though it was). The solution? Group A set up a regular 
meeting to communicate on their various projects with group B, making sure to 
get everyone's buy-in explicitly.</p><p>Here's another one: My co-author on the 
VB version of my WinForms book has been working like a dog on his new job and 
his new baby and the VB port of my book. However, since most of his 
communications were with the publishing company directly, I didn't see most of 
the work that he was doing and, because of our tight schedule, that caused me to 
worry that we wouldn't make it. The solution? I asked him about it and he told 
me of the pile of work he'd done that I didn't know about. He also volunteered 
to make sure to cc me on all of his email related to the book.</p><p>And here's 
my favorite example: For a long, long time, MS was labeled (and is often still 
labeled) as an &quot;evil&quot; because of a perceived uncaring about developer's hopes 
and dreams. Ironically, with a software engineer at the helm, all of Microsoft's 
decisions are driven by that need to meet the needs of 3rd party developers. The 
issue was communication, both in letting internal folks make their intentions 
known to the external folks and in getting the hopes and dreams of external 
folks into the planning processes of internal folks. It's my belief that the

Scott</a>, <a href="http://sapid.com/tommy/">Tommy</a>, and tons 
of other MS employees are not only <i>not </i>reprimanded for our blog posts, 
but <i>encouraged</i>, is so that our intentions can be known to external folks. 
And believe me, when someone external puts a substantive comment into their blog 
and one of the thousands of MS employees finds it, it makes its way into the 
inboxes of the internal MS employees that use that feedback. This need for <i>
bi-directional communication </i>between internal and external folks at MS has 
driven all kinds of new ways of doing things and you're going to see a whole lot 
more of that at the PDC.</p><p>I could keep going on for days about problems in 
my life that are solved with communication and could have been avoided with 
communication up front. In fact, I'm started to get a feel for it when I realize 
that my communication could have been better and what problem I'm going to have 
because it wasn't. Also, I've recently started to try to really concentrate on 
what my friends and family are saying when they start conversations with me 
while I'm working. (Previously I would continue working, giving a grunt now and 
again, as necessary.) This little thing has made a big difference. Of course, 
lots of folks way smarter than I already know this stuff, but to a geek who only 
learned how to communicate with other humans relatively recently, this is deep 
thinking! BTW, don't tell my sister-in-law with the Master's degree in 
communications. We give each other crap all the time on any number of topics and 
the idea that she knows more about what's really important in the world would 
give her all kinds of extra ammunition (which she rarely needs anyway... : )</p>
