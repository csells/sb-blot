<a href="http://rover.cs.nwu.edu/~surana/blog/#000077">Here</a>. While I don't necessarily agree with surana, I so loved the way that he stated his opinions that I had to post it here (even if it is 3 weeks old!). My favorite quote is:

"...programmers are idiots... XP's pair programming is laughable. Can two idiots do much better than one?"

You gotta admire a guy that isn't afraid to speak his mind. : )
