<h1>Applied XML Conference Sessions Chosen</h1>
<a href="/conference">Here</a>. Not only were there 4x the number of sessions submitted that could be accepted, but the quality bar was so high that it was almost impossible to narrow them down. The good news for attendees is that the ones we picked are going to rock.

The seating for Applied XML is limited and all previous DevCons have sold out, so you may want to grab your seat now. And once youâ€™ve done that, please spread the word! The more XML and web services zealots in one place, the better!
