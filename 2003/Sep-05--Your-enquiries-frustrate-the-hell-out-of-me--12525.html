<h1>"Your enquiries frustrate the hell out of me"</h1>
<p><i>Friday, <span class="created">September 5, 
2003</span></i></p><p>I would classify my style of communication as &quot;get to conflict 
sooner rather than later.&quot; A radio DJ once classified engineering abilities as a 
series of personality flaws that are accidentally useful in today's IT industry 
and, arguably, he's right. For most folks that have to work with me, it's 
generally hard at first, but eventually you either love me or hate me (and I 
continuously work to tip that percentage towards the former : ).</p><p>However, 
it's the rare individual that can see past someone's personal communications 
style and still pull out the value. Alan Cooper is one such person. I was 
reading one of his books and was so lost that I called and blamed him and his 
parents. He straightened me out by letting politely me know that he book wasn't 
even trying to solve my problems and therefore it's not surprising that it 
didn't. Further, he ended his email like this:</p><blockquote>&quot;PS. Your 
	enquiries frustrate the hell out of me. That's why they are good and I want 
	you to keep making them. If I growl at you, well, that's my problem. Not 
	yours.&quot;</blockquote><p>I don't know if other people would appreciate Alan 
encouraging my behavior, but it's still cool to know that such tolerance exists 
in the world. : )</p>
