<h1>Another Reason That Feedster Rocks</h1>
<a href="http://www.feedster.com">Here</a>. When asked properly, Feedster will return search results in RSS format. That means that I can subscribe to RSS feeds for topics that I care about in the blogisphere without having to spend any time surfing to feedster.com.

When combined with recent versions of SharpReader that has built in support for Feedster, I can enter a search term directly in SR, press Enter, press Subscribe, and I've got myself another "intelligent agent" to go along with the ones I'm already using [1-2].

Why doesn't Google provide their results in RSS? Anyone built an RSS gateway for Google yet?
