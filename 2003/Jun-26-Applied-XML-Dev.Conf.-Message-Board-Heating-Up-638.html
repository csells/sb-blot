<h1>Applied XML Dev.Conf. Message Board Heating Up</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/MessageBoard.aspx?id=3714">Here</a>. The message board for the Applied XML Developer's Conference is heating up a bit. I set it up for the audience to be able to communicate during the presentations, but folks are already using it to coordinate Dev.Conf.-related activites. Enjoy.
