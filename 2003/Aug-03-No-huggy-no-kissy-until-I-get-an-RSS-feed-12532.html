<h1>No huggy, no kissy, until I get an RSS feed</h1>
<p>
Before RSS took over, I had a folder named &quot;Daily&quot; which had links to all of the 
URLs that I surfed to on a daily basis. One problem was that for the sites that 
changed daily, it was a pain to decide what was new. An even bigger problem was 
the ones that didn't change daily. Eventually, the pain of surfing to them daily 
was outweighed by the pleasure I would get when those sites were finally 
updated. A bunch of my friends' infrequently updated blogs fall into this 
category (you know who you are : ).</p><p>Sure, RSS is useful to track <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/08/02.html#a4126">
Scoble as he shirks his moving duties</a>, but even more useful to track <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald/default.aspx">
Tim when he eventually does update his blog</a>. With RSS, I don't have to 
experience any pain surfing to Tim's blog day after day. Instead, I let <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net">
SharpReader</a> poll Tim's blog and when it's finally updated, I'll know about 
it. All gain; no pain.</p><p>What that means, unfortunately, is that I only read 
blogs with RSS feeds, because I've long ago gotten out of the habit of surfing 
my &quot;Daily&quot; folder. So when Josh Trupin (editor of MSDN Magazine) gave his 
reasons for being out of the office on Monday, he had to send me an email with a 
link to <a href="http://www.cynicor.com/blog/">the description 
of his horrific train injury detailed on his blog</a>. As fun a writer as Josh 
is, I won't go back (unless Google brings me there) 'til he's got an RSS feed. 
I've been hurt before; now I'm older and wiser and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/6103/keepyour.html">
require an RSS feed before I'm willing to wed myself to a blog</a>.</p>
