<h1>Don Box Shows K&R Hello, World in XAML</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2003-11-07T07:41:40Z">Here</a>. I think Don wins the prize for most obfuscated "Hello, World" implementation, but he does drive the point home nicely that XAML has nothing to do with Avalon and everything to do with declaring classes in .NET.

Of course, most folks will think of XAML for declaring Avalon UI, but who knows what fun things will come out of the truth?
