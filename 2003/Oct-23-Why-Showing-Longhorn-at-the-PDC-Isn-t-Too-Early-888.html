<h1>Why Showing Longhorn at the PDC Isn't Too Early</h1>
<a href="http://longhornblogs.com/scobleizer/posts/345.aspx">Here</a>. Robert lays out why it's important that MS show off our current Longhorn thinking ASAP: so that we can incorporate as much of your feedback as humanly possible.

Unfortunately, Robert frames his post in terms of hatred for MS, which is a bit more negative then necessary, I think. Still, given his current status as the I-hate-MS-lightning-rod, I'm not surprised that he covers his head on his way outdoors... : )
