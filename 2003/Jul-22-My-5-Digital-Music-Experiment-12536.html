<h1>My $5 Digital Music Experiment</h1>
<p>I 
*really* want to own my digital songs, so I've been dying for a real site to 
purchase them one at a time, instead of buying entire albums I don't want or 
ripping the songs off of the albums I do own. Towards that end, I was excited 
about BuyMusic.com and immediately spend $4.95 on five Avril songs. Overall, it 
was not a happy experience.</p><p>What I love about BuyMusic.com is the site:</p><ul><li>
	The web site is very usable and full-featured, making finding, listening to 
	and ordering artists, songs and albums easy</li><li>The price is right: 
	$.99/song and $9.49/album</li><li>I really wanted to immediately find the 
	web service so that I could write a program to go through my wife's bootleg 
	mp3s and purchase them</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, I hate BuyMusic.com 
because of the Digital Rights Management (DRM) experience:</p><ul><li>On one 
	machine, I could listen to all of the songs, but only after a &quot;DRM upgrade&quot; 
	(whatever that means)</li><li>On another machine, I had to do systems 
	administration to play a song (DRM doesn't like it when you're a guest and 
	an administrator in the same account). This is fine for me, because I can 
	chase the error to the web page and do the systems administration on my 
	account, but what about normal people? Then I had to do another DRM upgrade. 
	*Then* I had to log in with my user name and password on *every* song! That 
	means I have to roam around to every machine in my house that might possibly 
	want to listen to the music, because only I know the email/password for the 
	songs I buy. What a PITA!</li><li>I'm allowed three machines? Why? I can 
	take my CDs to any machine in the house and my cars. I want to own this 
	music for life and I *know* I'll have more than 3 machines before the end of 
	it. I tried it on four machines and it didn't turn me away, which is nice, 
	but how long will that last?</li><li>How are these WMA files going to work 
	with my mp3 player? Even if the format works, will the DRM get in the way?</li><li>
	What about if I download a bunch of songs on my way out the door? If I'm on 
	an airplane, I can't jack into the Internet to obtain the license and there 
	was no &quot;pre-license&quot; batch mode that I could find to save me from obtaining 
	the licenses one at a time</li></ul><p>The whole experience made me want to 
cry. The site was so great, but the playback was *so* hard. Why do I have to be 
treated like a child? I'm dying to pay for the music I want, but I don't want to 
be penalized for it. I really wanted to find the inevitable hacking tool to 
strip the DRM off of the music I downloaded so that I could use it more freely, 
but what's the point of that? This kind of hacking would break the license 
agreement and is no better than downloading mp3s (although the the latter is a 
hell of a lot more convenient).</p>
