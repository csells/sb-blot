<h1>Joel on Character Set Encodings</h1>
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">Here</a>. Joel lays out a very nice piece on encoding that drives home one point very clearly, "There Ain't No Such Thing As Plain Text." He also provides some supporting facts, which makes it all the more fun. Enjoy.
