<h1>In Search of Expertise</h1>
<p>I had an 
interesting insight while watching <i>Episode II: Attack of the Clones </i>(I 
had a hankering to see Yoda kick some butt, OK?!?). The definition of <i>expert </i>
is someone that just does whatever it is they do; they don't think about it. 
Everyone else is just learning. What drove this home for me was when Anakin 
heard of his mother being taken and how everyone else had failed or died looking 
for her, Anakin started out after her without any planning whatsoever. *That's* 
an expert. Of course, he had The Force and the rest of us have to live with an 
average amount of midichlorian, but he'd done what I've seen other experts do, 
too: unconscious competence.</p><p>The reason that this is such an insight for 
me is that for my entire life, I've always felt that there were special people 
in the world that just know what they're doing. These people worked in companies 
or were members of a profession and by their association with those 
organizations, I felt that they must be experts. I mean, how could someone be a 
member of professional for any length of time and not strive for mastery of the 
professional? It was watching Anakin that it finally sunk in that mere 
association is not enough; most organizations, no matter how high their 
standards, do not stop non-experts at the door. Experts are the ones inside the 
organizations that rise to the top, that stand out, that set examples for other 
members. Expertise is the thing that separates a moderately smart person 
studying up on a topic for a while from someone that really understands 
something down to their bones. This is what separates me catching up to my 
financial advisor after 6 months of study from a *real* money manager. That's 
what separates a new computer science graduate from me.</p><p>That's not to say 
that I couldn't be better than some &quot;real&quot; money managers one day or that the 
new college grad couldn't be better then me on day one. What it does say, 
however, is that encountering a true expert is a rare thing. Because of that 
rarity, I believe that most reasonably intelligent people can, with study and 
practice, get good at practically anything that they set their mind to. This 
means that I can, with a reasonable amount of study and practice, check the work 
of my financial advisor or my accountant or a plumbing contractor and come up 
with things that they don't. I know that this is true because I've done it (not 
with the plumbing though, I'm practically clueless there : ). The amount of 
study I needed to catch up with my professional service provider doesn't make me 
an expert, of course, because <i>it's highly unlikely that either of them is an 
expert</i>.</p><p>So, now that I've settled the question of whether membership 
in a profession makes one an expert (it doesn't), that leaves two questions:</p><ol><li>
	How do you recognize expertise? I know it when it occurs in something that 
	I'm familiar with, e.g. computer goo, but what about in a discipline where 
	I'm not versed?</li><li>How do you obtain expertise? I've got this down to <a href="#How_Does_One_Obtain_Inside_Information">
	a science for programming APIs</a>, but can these techniques be applied to 
	other disciplines?</li></ol><p><a href="/921">
Comments on my continued quest for expertise welcome.</a></p>
