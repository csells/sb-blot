<h1>Respect for Marketing</h1>
<p>Even in 
my short time at Microsoft so far, I've have already learned a *ton* from 
marketing. Of course, I'm working with lots of marketing folks as we get closer 
to the PDC. Because of my role, I have to worry about what's good for the 
developer. Marketing guys, on the other hand, have to balance that with what's 
good for the administrator, what's good for the user, what's good for the 
company, what's good for the shareholders and what's good for a bunch of other 
folks I don't even know about. And, they have to do it for all of the streams of 
information coming out of the company, which now includes lots of informal 
streams like newsgroups, message boards, user group talks and blogs. Anyone that 
can balance all of these folks and still get developers what they need has my 
unabashed respect.</p>
