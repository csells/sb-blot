<h1>Microsoft XSD Inference 1.0</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/xmltools/">Here</a>. Because I don't believe humans can know how to write XSD files from scratch *and* remember where their car keys are, I've been dying for an XSD inference tool that can take a bunch of XML files and produce a starting point XSD.

Towards that end, I fed the 200+ XML files for Dave's Quick Search Taskbar Toolbar Deskbar (dqsd.net) into the MS XSD Inference tool. The result was good enough to work with xsd.exe to generate C# classes and to impress Glenn Carr (Dave's XML guy).

Highly recommended.
