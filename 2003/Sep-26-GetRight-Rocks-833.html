<h1>GetRight Rocks</h1>
<a href="http://www.getright.com/">Here</a>. I thought the days when I'd have to use a download manager were gone when the cable internet guy showed up, but that's not the case. This morning I was dying to see the new Matrix: Revolutions theatrical trailer, but the thematrix.com site was slashdotted, so no amount of viewing in streaming mode or downloading would work because my connection to the server kept being reset.

So, from my modem days, I remembered GetRight and was pleased to see that they were still there, but now on version 5. With a quick install, I went back to thematrix.com, clicked on the link to download and GetRight instantly took over. Of course, the connection was reset again, but GetRight was all over it, resuming it w/in 60 seconds ('til I set the resume pause to 5 seconds : ). And, as if that weren't enough, GetRight let me download the file in 4 separate segments, further speeding things up.

I used to recommend GetRight all the time to my friends and now I'm doing it again. While this kind of stuff should be built into IE or the OS, if it's not, I'm glad that there is somebody out there filling the niche.

BTW, the new Matrix trailer rocks...
