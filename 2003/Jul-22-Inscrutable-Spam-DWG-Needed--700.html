<h1>Inscrutable Spam: "DWG Needed"</h1>
If this is spam, I fail to see what they're selling, but I was amused anyway:

"I'm a time traveler stuck here in 2003. Since nobody here seems to be able to get me what I need (safely here to me), I will have to build a simple time travel circut to get where I need myself. I am going to need an easy to follow picture diagram for a simple time travel circut, which can be built out of (readily available) parts here in 2003. Please email me any schematics you have. I will pay good money for anything you send me I can use Or if you have the rechargeable AMD dimensional warp generator wrist watch unit available, and are 100% certain you have a (secure) means of delivering it to me please also reply. Send a separate email to me at: info@federalfundingprogram.com."

I admit to sending an email with my regrets (what time travel-related plans I possess are incomplete), but expressed my willingness to accept "good money." : )
