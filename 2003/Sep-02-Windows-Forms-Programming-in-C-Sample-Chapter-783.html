<h1>Windows Forms Programming in C# Sample Chapter</h1>
<a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/catalog/product.asp?product_id={B757E215-0FB4-4EA1-A051-65EE537AE9C7}">Here</a>. AW has been kind enough to post the preface and a sample chapter (Chapter 9: Design-Time Integration) to the official AW Windows Forms Programming in C# book page. They've also posted Mike Blaszczak's foreword. Enjoy.
