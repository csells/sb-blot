<h1>New Software at Spout Manor</h1>
Apparently someone has confused me with Jerry Pournelle and has started sending me software.

At least ActiveWords came in an email and the guy who sent it was nice about it (although I admit to installing it and then uninstalling it w/o getting much use out of it).

Today I just got the full version of PowerBASIC in the mail. Apparently these folks don't know where I work. : )

Doesn't anyone know what PowerBASIC is? Is it cool? I plan on giving it away (if I can) at the Applied XML Developer's Conference.
