<h1>MS Discusses Next-Generation Secure Computing Base</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2003/may03/05-07NGSCB.asp">Here</a>. "Security and privacy are two of the most important -- and difficult -- issues facing the computer industry. Improving the ability of software and hardware to protect the integrity of digital information and the privacy of computer users has become a critical focus for both software developers and hardware manufacturers. Last June, Microsoft introduced a new security technology, code-named "Palladium" at the time, that is designed to provide the foundation for a new approach to security and privacy in Windows. Now known as the Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB) for Windows, this technology utilizes an innovative hardware and software design to protect against malicious software in order to enhance privacy, security, and system integrity and help insure that software acts in a way that customers can rely on."
