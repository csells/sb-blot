<h1>Startup, Shutdown & related matters</h1>
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/cbrumme/permalink.aspx/dac5ba4a-f0c8-42bb-a5cf-097efb25d1a9">Here</a>. Apparently cbrumme was backed up after two weeks fighting the blaster virus internally, because he lets loose with a tour de force of details about managed and unmanaged startup and shutdown as well as a trailer on writing secure code in general. Fun to read if you like this level of detail (and the part about secure code at the end should be read by everyone).
