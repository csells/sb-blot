<h1>Another Great Set of WinForms Controls</h1>
<a href="http://www.divil.co.uk/net/controls/">Here</a>. Duncan [1] points out Tim Dawson's set of WinForms controls, all of which are either free or cheap for commercial apps. Not only are the controls well-designed and flexible, they're also documented with a set of tutorials and provide an extensive design-time experience. I don't know how someone can make a living giving this stuff away, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy Tim's generosity.
