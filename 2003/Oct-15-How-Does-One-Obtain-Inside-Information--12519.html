<h1>How Does One Obtain "Inside" Information?</h1>
<p><i>Wednesday, <span class="created">October 15, 
2003</span></i></p><p>I got an email today from John Reilly today asking me a question 
I get from time to time:</p><blockquote><p><i>I got my signed copy of <a href="/public/writing/wfbook">
	your book</a>. It is a great read. You have information that a friend and I 
	have been trying to dig out for weeks.</i></p><p><i>Which leads me to our 
	question. How do you find out all those details? They are not to be found in 
	the MSDN documentation, as far as we can tell. Do you just experiment, like 
	we do? We have been unable to find any .NET training that is much more than 
	how to use the IDE. Alan and I crave detail, meat, the stuff of your book. 
	Seriously, how does one obtain this seemingly inside information? We are 
	personally and professionally motivated weenies.</i></p></blockquote><p>Now 
that I'm a Microsoft employee, I have access to not only the source for most of 
what I'm researching, but the architects and internal mailing lists populated by 
the developers on the project, so that really is &quot;inside information.&quot; However, 
over the 8+ years that I was a contributing member of the Windows developer 
community, 99% of what I've done has not been based on inside information. So, 
before I had access to internal info, how did I figure stuff out if the docs 
don't answer my questions? I do the following, in order of decreasing frequency:</p><ul><li><span style="">
	I experiment, writing hundreds of projects consisting of 10 lines of code or 
	less to experiment with particular features</span></li><li><span style="">I 
	read the source, even if that means reverse engineering it first (<a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/">Reflector 
	is fabulous for .NET code</a>)</span></li><li><span style="">I search on the <a href="http://www.google.com/microsoft.html">
	Microsoft-specific Google search page</a></span></li><li><span style="">I 
	IM, email and call my friends who know more than I do (which is most of them 
	: )</span></li><li><span style="">I ask questions on my <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic">
	favorite</a> <a href="http://discuss.develop.com">mailing</a> <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/community/messageboard/Home.aspx">
	lists</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/newsgroups/">
	newsgroups</a></span></li><li><span style="">As a last resort, I ask my 
	friends at MS. Buying a Microsoftie a beer at a conference, being smart in 
	online forums and saying nice things about their technologies are all 
	excellent ways to gain friends at MS</span></li></ul>
