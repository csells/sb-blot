<h1>"Move over Petzold, Sells is here."</h1>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321116208/chrissells">Here</a>. I'm sure it won't last, but the WinForms book has broken 1000 (908) and has an average 5-star rating with three reviews, saying very nice things like:

"This book rocks! ... All chapters are brilliant."

"The localisation and resource usage in the managed world are clearly described and you won't lose hours trying to access resources in your code anymore!"

"I stayed up all last night reading Chris' new book... I enjoyed every single page."

And, of course, the quote that makes my life complete:

"Move over Petzold, Sells is here."
