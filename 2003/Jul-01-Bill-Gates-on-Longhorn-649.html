<h1>Bill Gates on Longhorn</h1>
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-06-29-gates-longhorn_x.htm">Here</a>. Besides the cool scenarios BillG mentions that that Longhorn will enable, I like his answer to USA Today asking how long it will be before Longhorn is available:

"Years. At this time we're doing the prototyping â€” feasibility studies, performance studies. We don't have a date because what we have is a technological breakthrough that we have to really make sure we refine and get right. Then we'll get to the point where we'll set up an engineering schedule."
