<h1>30+ People Already Going to the Applied XML Conf.</h1>
<a href="/conference">Here</a>. I don't mean to rush anyone, but there's already about 30 people signed up for the Applied XML conference. Some of this includes speakers, of course, because they always attend the conference, too, but plenty of folks have already registered just since 5pm on Friday. 'nuf said.
