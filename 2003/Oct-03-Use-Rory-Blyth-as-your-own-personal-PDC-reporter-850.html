<h1>Use Rory Blyth as your own personal PDC reporter</h1>
<a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/permalink.aspx/7c86cfcd-fc98-4c49-982a-e750e9eb54d4">Here</a>. Rory Blyth, potentially the most entertaining writer in the bloggesphere, has offered to be your own personal PDC reporter, attending the topics that you can't and writing them up for you. I'm not sure if he's willing to do this, but maybe you could talk him into wearing your clothers while he does it. I'm XXL, Rory, and like neon colors. I'll send my session schedule later today and you just hit all the ones I can't, OK? Great. Thanks!
