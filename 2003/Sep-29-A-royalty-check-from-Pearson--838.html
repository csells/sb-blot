<h1>A *royalty* check from Pearson!</h1>
<a href="/writing">Here</a>. Whoa. I just got a royalty check from Pearson today. Right now, it lists my advance for the WinForms book (which may turn into positive money some day), but also includes money from ATL Internals (which I'm still proud of) and Windows Telephony Programming (which I can't believe is still selling!). I won't be able to put my kids through college with the money. In fact, I can barely put them through a car wash with that money, but it's still nice. : )
