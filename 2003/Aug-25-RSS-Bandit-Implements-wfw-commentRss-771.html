<h1>RSS Bandit Implements wfw:commentRss</h1>
<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/23/154240/533">Here</a>. Dare released a new version of RSS Bandit that, among other things, implements my RSS extension that exposes comments for an RSS entry via an RSS feed [1]. Dare's implementation is not only *exactly* what I had in mind when I proposed the extension (thanks, Dare!) but I think this also address's Shawn's request from the other day [2].
