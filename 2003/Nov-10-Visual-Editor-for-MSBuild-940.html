<h1>Visual Editor for MSBuild</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=2cb20e79-d706-4706-9ea0-26188257ee7d">Here</a>. For those of you that don't like writing raw XML if you can help it and that Don and Tim haven't yet converted, there's a Visual Editor for MSBuild. Of course, it's not VS.NET, but what is? : )
