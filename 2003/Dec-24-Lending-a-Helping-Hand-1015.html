<h1>Lending a Helping Hand</h1>
<a href="/12511">Here</a>. Normally I wouldn't pass along something like this, but this is from my uncle and therefore genuine. If you can <a href="/12511">lend a hand to his brother</A> who's financially destitute after a liver and kidney transplant, I'd appreciate it. Even prayers would help. Thanks!
