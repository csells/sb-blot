<h1>Priceless</h1>
<ul><li>Running sellsbrothers.com for one month: $150</li><li>
	Round-trip ticket from OR to FL to give a 90-minute talk: $1200</li><li>My 
	son picking me for his &quot;famous person&quot; school report: priceless</li></ul><p>
I don't know how my son picked up on the tiny bit of fame I've acquired amongst 
a small, strange (but loveable!) group of people, but he did and now he thinks 
I'm cool. I'm sure it won't last, but I plan to enjoy it while it does. : )</p>
