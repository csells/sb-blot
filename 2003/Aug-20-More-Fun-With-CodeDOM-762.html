<h1>More Fun With CodeDOM</h1>
<a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/weblog/permalink.aspx?guid=ba3dfd80-387b-4be0-83ff-293024e8d425">Here</a>. In a recent debate over writing the n very similar algorithms by hand (one for each number of inputs) vs. writing a data-driven algorithm to handle any number of inputs, Peter takes the middle route using the .NET CodeDOM to generate the simple algorithm for the required number of inputs at run-time.

What makes this interesting isn't the result, which didn't turn out to be the most efficient, but the approach itself, which is unique to metadata-enabled systems and something I completely forgot even existed. Thanks for the reminder, Peter!
