<h1>Amazon.com + Kevin Bacon-style Relation Paths</h1>
<a href="http://www.baconizer.com/">Here</a>. I was hanging out with Eric Promislow from ActiveState this week and he pointed me at his "Baconizer" web site, which will connect a path between any two books (or CDs or DVDs).

For example, from "The Best of Martha Stewart Living : Weddings" to "Mastering Visual Studio .NET" is only 11 hops (and some time in prison).

Hours of fun for the whole family.
