<h1>Eric Sink Tells the Story of His First BoS Column</h1>
<a href="http://software.ericsink.com/20031027.html#10132">Here</a>. I'm very pleased to have Eric Sink of SourceGear fame writing for the experimental Business of Software section [1] of the Longhorn Developer Center. He's not only a successfuly ISV, but also a wonderful communicator and I look forward to reading more of his stuff, in spite of the minor communication problem we started off with. : )
