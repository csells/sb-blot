<h1>My First Week @ MS</h1>
<p><i>
<span class="created">Friday, April 25, 2003</span></i></p><p>After my first week at Microsoft *everyone* wanted to 
know how it went, both internally and externally. I learned some things:</p><ul><li>
	I learned that folks at MS will call a meeting for lots and lots of reasons, 
	including at the slightest sign of confrontation or hurt feelings. For a guy 
	that hasn't really attended a meeting in the last decade, this is quite a 
	switch : )</li><li>I learned how to schedule a meeting w/ multiple people 
	and a conference room (listed as &quot;conf room &lt;bld&gt;&quot; in the address book), all 
	with conflicting schedules and all remotely using Outlook Web Access and 
	without a SmartCard (I was pretty proud of that one, actually : )</li><li>I 
	learned that no one uses the phone for anything -- instead, they schedule 
	meetings</li><li>I learned that it's the person that wants something that 
	does the actually scheduling of the meeting</li><li>I learned that it's OK 
	to open your laptop in a meeting, otherwise when would you get any work 
	done?</li><li>I learned that it causes quite a stir when you disagree with 
	the technical lead of one of the major pieces of technology that you're 
	supposed to be taking to the world</li><li>I learned that it's darn hard to 
	find out who to talk to your first week, and that you should take your boss 
	to most of your initial meetings so that s/he can make sure you're getting 
	what you need to get from them</li><li>I learned that you can mix Exchange 
	and POP3/SMTP to keep your new and your old email addresses going, if you 
	use Office 11 and if you are willing to give up calendar and follow up 
	notifications on your POP3/SMTP account (have I missed something?). I also 
	learned that internal MS support doesn't help w/ such things.</li><li>I 
	learned that internal MS support is the greatest support in the whole darn 
	world. These people don't let you off the phone 'til everything works. 
	They're amazing</li><li>I learned that you can volunteer for absolutely 
	anything you think is cool or important so long as you get everything else 
	done, too</li><li>I learned that it's not good to ask for NDA access to 
	super-secret bits for your friends the week before you start working there 
	(OK, I'm pretty sure I knew that before, but I had to try... : )</li><li>I 
	learned that the right folks hanging out at lunch can make all kinds of 
	interesting things happen</li><li>I learned that MS and it's employees is 
	the most charitable company in the country (world?)</li><li>I learned that 
	the internal resources for MS employees are unbelievable. I could work their 
	my whole life and never take advantage of all of them</li><li>I learned that 
	it's important to sign up for your benefits immediately if you're going to 
	be remote w/o a SmartCard for a while, otherwise your son may wake you up in 
	the middle of the night with a hard toothache and when you take him to the 
	dentist the next day, the dentist won't be able to confirm your dental 
	insurance (as one example : )</li><li>I learned that most everyone at MS is 
	very nice (even when they're telling you to f-off)</li><li>I learned that 
	everyone (and I'm no exception) has a hard time fitting in at first. One 
	interviewer told me that his first 6 months at MS were the worst of his 
	life. I pray that it doesn't last that long for me</li><li>I learned that 
	after the initial period that few that survive it would ever think of 
	leaving. I absolutely see how that could be</li></ul>
