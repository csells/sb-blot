<h1>My 
First Press Contact @ MS</h1>
<p>Today I 
spoke with Todd Bishop, a reporter from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer (&quot;the 
Seattle PI&quot;). He was interested in my spout entries about my initial experiences 
with Microsoft, specifically <a href="#submittingToBillgThinkWeek">the BillG 
ThinkWeek stuff</a>. He called last week, but I didn't call him back right away. 
Instead, I asked my grandboss (my boss was out on vacation) what I should do. I 
remember <a href="#boldBeginning">during NEO</a> that MS has very clear 
instructions about when to talk to the press, i.e. never. Of course, some folks 
at MS talk with the press, but unless it's specifically part of your job, you're 
supposed to refer the press to other folks more trained in the ways of the wily 
reporter trying to get the dirt on MS.</p><p>So, when Todd called and I hadn't 
yet made my millions on MS stock options (any day now... : ), I thought I'd ask 
around first before making any career limiting moves. That was early last week. 
It wasn't 'til today that I got the approval to give the interview. In fact, I'm 
pretty the MS marketing guy checking on what Todd was up to had a longer 
conversation than I did. Here's pretty much the entire conversation (paraphrased 
from imperfect human memory):</p><blockquote><p>Todd: &quot;Thanks for getting back 
	to me, Chris. I'm glad you went though official channels. That tends to make 
	things go easier.&quot;</p><p><i>I thought that was strange. If I was a reporter, 
	I'd want to track down the defenseless MS employee when they were least 
	expecting it. That's what I figured Todd was up to when he called my direct 
	MS line w/o any introductions. Luckily, I work from home in PDX. Bwa ha ha 
	ha ha!</i></p><p>Chris: &quot;No problem, Todd. Sorry it took so long to get back 
	to you. They were clear my first day at MS not to talk to the press unless 
	explicitly instructed and I'm new.&quot;</p><p>Todd: &quot;Did you get the list of 
	things I'm after? I've already written the story; I just want to check some 
	facts.&quot;</p><p><i>Oh sure, I thought. This is Todd buttering Chris like 
	toast...</i></p><p>Chris: &quot;Yes. What can I tell you?&quot;</p><p>Todd: &quot;You spell 
	your last name S-E-L-L-S?&quot;</p><p>Chris: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>Todd: &quot;What's your 
	position at Microsoft?&quot;</p><p>Chris: <i>detailed explanation of MSDN, 
	DevCenters (including their need in the world) and how I'm doing the 
	Longhorn DevCenter.</i></p><p>Todd: &quot;Can I just say you're an MSDN Content 
	Strategist?&quot;</p><p>Chris: &quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p><i>So now the reporter's got me 
	giving him more info than he actually wants. I'm in trouble...</i></p><p>
	Todd: &quot;And your blog is http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout?&quot;</p><p>Chris: <i>
	long explanation about how I organize my site, how the Spout is just the 
	editorial section and that I announce everything from all sections on my 
	home page.</i></p><p>Todd: &quot;Oh. So your blog is just 
	http://www.sellsbrothers.com. I'll correct that. Thanks. That's all I need.&quot;</p><p>
	Chris: &quot;Really? I expected to be grilled.&quot;</p><p>Todd: &quot;Well, you're lucky 
	you waited. If you'd have called last week, I'd have really hammered you.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>
Aha! He's just lulling me into a false sense of security for next time! : )</p><p><i>
