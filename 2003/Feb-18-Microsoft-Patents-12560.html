<h1>Microsoft & Patents</h1>
<p><i>Tue, <span class="created">Feb 18, 2003</span></i></p><p>The buzz was all around VSLive last week about Microsoft 
patenting the .NET Framework API. In fact, an eWEEK reporter asked my opinion 
and this is what I said:</p><blockquote>I'm no patent attorney, but in examining 
	the patent application, it looks to me as if they're claiming a patent for 
	the entire .NET Framework, which comprises the classes that a .NET 
	programmers uses to get anything done. My understanding of the patent laws 
	says that Microsoft has every right to do this, since they invented it. The 
	reason for them to do this is so that they can maintain control of its 
	implementation. Hopefully Microsoft will grant a royalty free license to all 
	implementations of the CLI ECMA standard, which makes up a large percentage 
	of the .NET Framework, or that standard will be worthless.</blockquote><blockquote>
	Even if they grant such a license, projects like Mono are still vulnerable. 
	They plan on implementing even the parts of .NET that aren't standardized, 
	like ASP.NET and WinForms. This would allow Windows programs compiled 
	against .NET to run under Mono on Linux, providing a single API for 
	cross-platform applications. This has been tried and failed in the past as 
	recently as Java, but I had hoped that the Mono guys could make this work. 
	When Microsoft is granted this patent, they can shut down the 
	non-standardized parts of Mono whenever they want. That's good for Microsoft 
	share holders, but it's not good for 3rd party developers that want to write 
	cross-platform solutions.</blockquote><p>What I should have added is that as 
far as I know, Microsoft hasn't ever enforced its patents. Apparently they keep 
them for defensive reasons only. Or, they could be waiting 'til they have a 
critical mass of patents, enforce them all at once and win the game of Risk that 
they're playing with the world. : )</p>
