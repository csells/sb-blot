<h1>Chris Sells on Longhorn for the TC .NET User Group</h1>
<P>I'm in Minnesota over the holidays, so I thought I'd drop in on <A href="http://www.ilmservice.com/twincitiesnet/default.aspx">the Twin Cities .NET User Group for a short discussion of Longhorn</A>. Please keep in mind that this talk is purely shelfish on my part -- I learn best by telling the story.</P>
