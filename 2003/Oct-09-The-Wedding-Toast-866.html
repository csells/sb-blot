<h1>The Wedding Toast</h1>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/yosit/posts/31385.aspx">Here</a>. Don and I send out a video of a toast to a newly married couple. We get back their reactions via video. Not as nice as real-time, but I don't get overseas much, so still very cool. You gotta love the Internet!
