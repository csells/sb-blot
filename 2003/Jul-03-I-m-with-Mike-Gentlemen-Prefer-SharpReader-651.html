<h1>I'm with Mike: Gentlemen Prefer SharpReader</h1>
<a href="http://www.sax.net/live/?date=7/3/2003#at12:58AM">Here</a>. Mike Sax says exactly what I was thinking. After having high hopes for FeedDemon [1], I *much* prefer SharpReader. Luke hit it out of the park on his first try and nobody's yet come close.
