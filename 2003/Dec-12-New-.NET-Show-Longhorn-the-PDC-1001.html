<h1>New .NET Show: Longhorn @ the PDC</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/episode038/default.asp">Here<a>. "In this episode of the .NET Show we focus on how 'Longhorn' was presented, and received, at the PDC. In our first segment we talk with key players in the Longhorn project, <B>Brad Abrams</B>, <B>Chris Anderson</B>, <B>Quentin Clark</B>, and <B>Pablo Fernicola</B> about the main messages that they are hoping developers at the PDC understand about Longhorn. We then switch the tables and talk with <B>Richard Hale Shaw</B>, <B>Simon Stewart</B>, and <B>Robb McLarty</B>, a diverse set of attendees of the PDC and hear straight from them what they think about Longhorn, and how it might affect their development efforts moving forward."
