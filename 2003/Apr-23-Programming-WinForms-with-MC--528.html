<h1>Programming WinForms with MC++</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/vctchWindowsFormsForManagedCProgrammers.asp">Here</a>. Sam Gentile and I wrote a piece on building WinForms apps in MC++ using the new designer support in VS.NET 2003. Unfortunately, it acquired some small errors along the publishing path, e.g. STA does not stand for "spanning three algorithm" in this case. However, the errors are minor and C++ programmers interested in the .NET forms engine should definately take a look.
