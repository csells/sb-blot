<h1>Serialization Basics, Part 1 of 3</h1>
<a href="http://www.windevnet.com/documents/s=7481/win1044571786904/">Here</a>. This is the first of a 3 part series I wrote as an appendix to my WinForms book because I couldn't find the topic of object serialization covered adequately elsewhere in any of the popular texts.

This part covers the basics of text and binary serialization for simple types.
