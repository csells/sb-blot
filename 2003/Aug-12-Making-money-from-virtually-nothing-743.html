<h1>Making money from virtually nothing</h1>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3135247.stm">Here</a>. In the "truth is stranger than fiction" category, Julian Dibbell is a full-time Ultima Online merchant, selling virtual things for real money. Some few virtual tycoons make 6 figures a year doing just this.

It's the wild west all over again, with a black market economy and no regulation. I predict that the next J.P. Morgan will come out of this space before regulators step in.
