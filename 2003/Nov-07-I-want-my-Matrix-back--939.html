<h1>I want my Matrix back!</h1>
<a href="http://www.pvponline.com/rants.php3">Here</a>. Seriously, how did one of the best movies in a generation disintegrate into Matrix: Revolutions? I was into the Matrix universe and was willing to let Matrix: Reloaded suck in a typical middle-movie kind of way, but what the hell happened in the 3rd one?!?

Anyway, I'm still reeling. Scott says it better than I can.
