<h1>SPOT On</h1>
<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/spot_preview.asp">Here</a>. While I think that the prototype watches are butt ugly, I really want to write apps for my watch. With a decent metal frame and a color screen, the Smart Personal Object Technology (SPOT) watches would rock. BTW, does anyone else thing that the Win32/.NET/SPOT windowing API needs to be updated for non-rectangular displays?
