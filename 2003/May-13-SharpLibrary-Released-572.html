<h1>SharpLibrary Released</h1>
<a href="http://www.sharplibrary.com">Here</a>. From Carlos H. Perez: The SharpLibrary is a comprehensive Graphical User Interface library written for the .NET Framework. It has as its main goal to alleviate a lot of the limitations of the standard controls in the WindowsForms namespace. As such, it enhances many of the default controls with needed features that developers often find themselves wishing the out of the box controls had. It also has its fare share of controls totally written from scratch when the standard controls were too limited to obtain a feature or there was simply not equivalent available. The result was controls that look good, are flexible, powerful and which also are free from the limitation, compatibility issues and just simply age that the native controls inherently have and thus are better suited for further enhancements that can accommodate the most demanding requirement of applications being written in the 21st century.
