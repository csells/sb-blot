<h1>Who Are the Good Web Services Bloggers?</h1>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mpowell/posts/35079.aspx">Here</a>. Matt Powell, the Content Strategist for the Web Services Developer Center, is looking for your opinions on web services-related blogs. Please let him know your thoughts.

In addition, he posts a signal/noise ratio rating for the blogs he's currently tracking. I *love* his description of Samy Ruby:

"Sam is very popular but has left the world of Web services as we know it."
