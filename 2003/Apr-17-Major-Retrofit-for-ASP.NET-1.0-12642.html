<h1>Major Retrofit for ASP.NET 1.0</h1>
    <P>This site, the logo, business cards and t-shirts were designed by <a href="http://www.guonan.com/">
        guonan</a>. She's got an amazing style and she's very easy to work with.</P>
    <P>The initial version of this site was implemented by 
	<a href="http://staff.develop.com/jfland/">Jon Flanders</a>. The way he was able to make conflicting requirements work 
      for this site was inspirational. Most of what I know about ASP.NET, I learned 
      from this site and Jon.</P>
    <P>Continuous grammar checking is provided by <a href="mailto:candera@alum.mit.edu">
        Craig Andera</a> (whether I want it or not : ).</P>
    <P>The site itself is hosted at <a href="http://www.securewebs.com">
        SecureWebs</a>.</P>
    <P>The implementation is a mixture of ASP.NET as the navigation and layout 
      framework and HTML for the content. My goals for the site were simple: look 
      nice, easy to maintain. I didn't want to give up FrontPage for my HTML editor 
      ('cuz it has the Word key bindings that are hard-coded into my brain : ), but I 
      wanted to be able to get the functionality of ASP.NET. So, the main content 
      comes for an ascx file that reads in the index.htm and strips off the head 
      section. Except for the home page, which is laid out specially, each 
      default.aspx on my site just pulls in a single pageLayout.ascx file that does 
      all of the layout using content from the target of the URL. By separating 
      content from layout, I get the best of both FrontPage and ASP.NET, making both 
      content and site maintenance easy.</P>
