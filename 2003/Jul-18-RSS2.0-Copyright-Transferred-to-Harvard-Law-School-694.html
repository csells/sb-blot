<h1>RSS2.0 Copyright Transferred to Harvard Law School</h1>
<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/07/18#rss20News">Here</a>. Dave Winer has transferred the copyright to RSS 2.0 to Harvard Law School as well as opened it up for more public feedback. This is good because RSS 2.0 is gaining in popularity but has come under fire lately for being controlled by Dave alone. Thanks, Dave.
