<h1>Kill Long URLs!</h1>
From Steven Livingstone: Playing around with some .Net so I figured this app would be useful to some of you folk who write HUGE url's in emails (yeah, like me). 

There's also some online encryption and digital signing at http://sightkeys.com/encrypt and http://sightkeys.com/encrypt/sign.aspx

Gimme a shout if you like or dislike or have anything to say.

Cheers,
Steven
