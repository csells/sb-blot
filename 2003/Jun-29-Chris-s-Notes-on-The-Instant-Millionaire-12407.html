<h1>Chris's Notes on The Instant Millionaire</h1>

		<p>Chris's Notes on
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0931432723/chrissells">
		The Instant Millionaire: A Tale of Wisdom and Wealth, Mark Fisher, New 
		World Library, 1991</a>. I recommend this book for folks that are 
		willing to believe that the act of willing something to happen hard 
		enough will make it happen.</p>
		<p>On the one hand, I've solved many an engineering problem by simply 
		letting my subconscious know that it needed solving. On the other hand, 
		I've never been able to successfully wish for something to happen. The 
		question is whether you view this book as channeling your subconscious 
		energies into finding ways of making your dreams of financial 
		independence come true or whether you view it as a fairy tale.</p>
