<h1>Men Extinct Soon -- Only 125K Years Left</h1>
<a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/edit/archives/2003/09/06/2003066731">Here</a>. As well as women would do without us, it's clear to me that the two sexes have evolved as a pair, although whether that'll be enough to make saving us worth the trouble, I don't know. For example, my wife may well decide to replace me with a footstool to reach things on the high shelves and call it good. : )
