<h1>Alan Cooper on the *Real* New Economy</h1>
<a href="http://www.ftponline.com/vsm/2003_11/magazine/departments/softwarearchitect/">Here</a>. Alan Cooper visited my house a coupla months ago and in addition to taking the excited Sells brothers and a shaky Tim and me for a ride in his 6-seater prop plane (where he made me fly most of the time, explaining why Tim and I were shaky), he and Tim and I had a mind-blowing conversation the likes of which I've had maybe a dozen times in my life. Tim and I talked about it for weeks afterwards and we're still different because of it, I think.

Anyway, a bit of what we talked about that weekend is in Alan's latest piece. Recommended.
