<h1>Every OS Sucks</h1>
<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/deadtroll2/.Movies/ossuckscable.html">Here</a>. "It was slow and it was buggy, so they wrote it again. Now they're up to OS 10. They'll charge you for the beta and then charge you again."

"Bill Gates may be richer than Captain Kirk, but Windows blows. And sucks. At the same time!"

"Linux... It's a great big mess for elitist, nerdy shmucks... Getting it running is half the fun, but I've got a girlfriend and things to get done."

Equal opportunity bashing of "everything since the abacus." Also hilarious.
