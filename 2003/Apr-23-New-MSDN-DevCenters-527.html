<h1>New MSDN DevCenters</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developercenters/">Here</a>. I'm sure that this is all over the web by now, but I couldn't help but congratulate my new team on a wonderful revamp of their most important content into Developer Centers (DevCenters) for architecture, web services, VS, VB, VC++, C#, J#, .NET and Windows Server 2003. It looks great, guys. Congrats!
