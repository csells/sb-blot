<h1>Mr. Blyth Goes To Town (Redmond, specifically...)</h1>
<a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/2106.aspx">Here</a>. <P>In his recent visit to Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, WA, he describes what I expected to find myself:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Out of the waiting room, we stepped into an airlock. I thought the airlock was a little over the top, but figured that Microsoft knew best, so I just went along with it.</P>
<P>The door behind us clanked shut, and my ears popped as the air pressure in the room changed. Some vents in the ceiling opened, and I heard a faint hissing noise.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Looking up, I saw a red mist swirling below the ceiling, corkscrewing, and drooping in little wisps. I felt confused, but figured that it was only because one hemisphere of my brain had been removed in order to accommodate the borg unit.</P>
<P>A few seconds later, I caught a sweet smell in the olfactory glands and a tingly sensation on my tongue. It smacked of tropical punch, with perhaps just a little too much sugar.</P>
<P>The taste was familiar. It reminded me of some far off childhood - summers on a tire-swing, baseball at the park, and other simple pleasures. There was a common thread woven through all these events, and it had to do with this taste. This sweet, sugary, tropical-punchity flavor... It tasted like.. like...</P><I>
<P>Eureka!</P></I>
<P><I>So</I>, I thought to myself, <I>Microsoft has finally figured out how to create an airborne Kool-Aid. This is an unexpected turn of events. I wonder what else these engineers of mayhem have in store for me. What, indeed..."</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Disappointingly, while <a href="/12553">the culture is very different from any other company I've ever encountered</A>, Microsoft is mostly normal (mostly... : ).</P>
