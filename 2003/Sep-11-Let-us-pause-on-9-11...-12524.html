<h1>Let us pause on 9/11...</h1>
<p>My 
8-year old was proud to remind me that today was the two-year anniversary of 
9/11. I was surprised that he knew and grateful to his school for taking the 
time to discuss it. He then went on to tell me how cool he thought the 
explosions were, which left me less pleased with his school. When I told him 
about my own experiences that day and how many people died, it immediately took 
all of the &quot;coolness&quot; right out of the day for him.<br><br>George Bullock, a 
colleague at MS who's birthday happens to fall on 9/11, has also had the 
&quot;coolness&quot; taken out of the day for him and sent around a mail that starts this 
way:<br><blockquote>&quot;Let us pause on 9/11 to remember and honor the thousands 
	killed, maimed, put out of work, and traumatized two years ago; also to 
	honor the heroic, living and dead, who rose to the occasion on that terrible 
	day. May God rest their souls and keep and protect their loved ones. May God 
	also keep and protect our men and women serving here and abroad. Yes, there 
	is much difference of opinion about what's happening in the world today; 
	nevertheless, I think we all support the men and women of our armed forces 
	and wish them a safe return home. They sacrifice a lot to serve their 
	country.&quot;</blockquote><p>Personally, I try very hard not to let the 
terrorists get to me. Unfortunately, they have. Even time I get the anal probe 
treatment at the airport or a personal freedom is taken away by the Patriot Act 
or my sister-in-law is afraid to fly (and flat out refuses to fly on that day), 
they win. More subtly, ever time a US politician uses &quot;terrorism&quot; to push their 
own agenda, they also win. Please don't let them win. Have courage. Try to 
understand what it was that drove them to terrorism to attract our attention. 
Compare their lives to ours. But don't let them win. Don't let them take the 
right to the pursuit of happiness out of our lives.</p>
