<h1>Typeless Schemas and Services</h1>
<a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/09/02/typeless.html">Here</a>. Any article that starts like this, I like:

"Chris Sells has been running a boutique developer's conference for a few years. It's currently called the 'Applied XML Developers Conference,' with the sub-title 'applied topics for XML and Web Services zealots.' The devcon is clearly a case where, contrary to the spam we all get, size doesn't matter: Chris attracts an influential set of speakers and attendees, and what is discussed at these conferences is often a leading indicator of major trends in web services."
