<h1>Hippo.NET Build Tool Released</h1>
<a href="http://hipponet.sf.net/">Here</a>. From Jan Tielens: Hippo.NET is a tool for streamlining the build process of .NET projects in a team envirionment. It provides continuous integration by monitoring the shared Visual SourceSafe database and starting the build process when changes are detected. An important design goal is to provide a nice and easy-to-use user interface, to monitor builds and trigger the build process when needed.

Now you can download a stable version of this tool, with full source code.

Current features are:
- Client/server model 
- Trigger build from remote clients 
- Implements the build process proposed by Microsoft 
- Automatic build number updates in AssemblyInfo files 
- Build history information 
- Current activity information 
- Fully configurable 
- Rich Windows Forms UI
