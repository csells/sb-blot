<h1>.NET ResourceExplorer</h1>

    <p align="left">In writing the resources chapter of my WinForms book, I 
    found that there was no single utility for displaying the resource contents of 
    assemblies, .resx files and .resource files (even embedded .resources files) 
    in a way that made sense to me. <a href="/public/tools/ResourceExplorer.zip">So, I built 
    one and called it ResourceExplorer.</a></p>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="/public/tools/img.2.jpg" width="328" height="184"></p>
    <p align="left">ResourceExplorer is very simple and could stand some 
    extension to show specific resources at images, text, data, etc, but it 
    certainly served my needs, especially when it came to understanding the 
    usage and limitations of the ResourceReader (for reading .resources files) 
    and the ResXResourceReader (for reading .resx files). Enjoy.</p>
