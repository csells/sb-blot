<h1>The Last Configuration Handler I'll Ever Need</h1>
<a href="http://staff.develop.com/candera/weblog/stories/2003/02/20/theLastConfigurationSectionHandlerIllEverNeed.html">Here</a>. From Craig Andera: I'm sure someone, somewhere has already written this, but I figured it out on my own today, and it's just too cool not to share. Basically, it's a bit of code that lets me store objects in my application or web configuration file, and all I have to do is write the type that holds the values.
