<h1>Windows Application Verifier</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/appexperience/appverifier.asp">Here</a>. "The Windows Application Verifier (AppVerifier) examines executable programs for common application quality issues. Running this tool on an application aids a tester in detecting issues dealing with stability, security, and compatibility."

This tool should be required for all QA departments, just like FxCop is required for all .NET developers.
