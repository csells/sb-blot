<h1>The XML Application Mark-up Language Reference</h1>
<a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/port_ref_elements.aspx">Here</a>. <a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/port_ref_elements.aspx"></a>Curious what all of the noise about XAML is about? This page in the Longhorn SDK is a complete reference to XAML as of the PDC03.

There are all *kinds* of interesting things to check out in XAML. My personal favorite is the Bind element, which is the tip of the data binding iceberg in Avalon.

Enjoy.
