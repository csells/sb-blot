<h1>Smart Displays Now Available</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/smartdisplay/">Here</a>. Oh man, I *so* want one of these, but I can't decide whether to get the 15" one and use it as a monitor as well as a tablet, get the 8" for cuddling up to in bed or something in the middle!

Also, does anyone know if these things support the same software as a TabletPC? They certainly should.
