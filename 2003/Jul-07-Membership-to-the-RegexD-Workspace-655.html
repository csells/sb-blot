<h1>Membership to the RegexD Workspace</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=01e0dfb7-0182-45cd-94f7-2ed2df2504a9">Here</a>. I've turned down pretty much everyone's membership request to the RegexD workspace not because I don't want new members, but because I want to see one proposed change to RegexD before approving anyone as a member w/ write priviledges to the code.

If you want to be a member, send include a link to an initial change in your request message so that I can check it out before approving your membership.
