<h1>Genghis v0.4</h1>
<p>Sorry for the long wait. There's been two whole books written between the last release of Genghis and <a href="/public/tools/genghis">this one</a>. Here's the list of new features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Everything works under .NET 1.0 and 1.1 (except HandleCollector)</li>
	<li>MSN Messanger-style popup window</li>
	<li>UI Type Editor for use with ImageList index selection</li>
	<li>AppBar implementation</li>
	<li>Text file search</li>
	<li>Themed controls</li>
	<li>Single instance application support, including passing command line args from other instances</li>
	<li>Multiple top-level window support</li>
	<li>Many enhancements and fixes to the command line parser</li>
	<li>Splash screen class</li>
	<li>Improved WebCommandLineHelper class which now works with .NET 1.0 and 1.1, includes URL decoding and requires no additional permissions (although it does require a server-side HTTP handler, included as the ConfigFileHandler class that maps requests for foo.exe?bar=quux.config to the foo.exe.config file)</li>
	<li>WizardSheet updates</li>
	<li>Status Bar Extender for mapping status messages to Windows Forms controls</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to my new build master, Mike Marshal, who got all of this together. He's the greatest!</p>
