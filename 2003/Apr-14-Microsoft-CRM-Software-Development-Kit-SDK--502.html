<h1>Microsoft CRM Software Development Kit (SDK)</h1>
<a href="http://www.only4gurus.com/v2/preview.asp?ID=2702">Here</a>. From Ramon: This SDK provides the information necessary for developers to integrate their applications into Microsoft CRM or to build a vertical solution on the Microsoft CRM platform. An architectural overview includes descriptions of the object and security models, as well as the integration points. The API references are documented and the database schema is provided. There is a “How To” section with sample code.
