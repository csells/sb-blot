<h1>MSDN Article Submission for Budding Authors</h1>
With the increasing number of folks pinging me about submitting Longhorn articles, I thought I'd point folks to the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/aboutmsdn/submit.asp">MSDN Article Submission Guidelines</A>, which describe how to establish a relationship with MSDN Developer Centers for article submission (<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/submit.aspx">MSDN Magazine has a separate process</A> for now). Unless you've got a track record and can talk a Developer Center into a series right off the bat, you're likely going to be working gratis on the first few articles 'til you've established a reputation, but it's a nice way for new authors to see their name in lights. If you've got a Longhorn-specific article idea, you can also <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Longhorn Article Idea">send it directly to me</A> for a slightly quicker way to get it into my hands.
