<h1>My First Meeting with a 
Senior VP</h1>
<p>On <a href="#myFirstMonthAtMs">
the anniversary of my first month at MS</a>, I took my first meeting with a Sr. 
Vice President. I'm told that's a big deal. One colleague who'd been at MS for a 
few years said, &quot;Wow. You must be important. I expect that the first time I'll 
be in a meeting with a Sr. VP will be at my firing.&quot; In my case, it's not that 
I'm important (I'm not) that got me involved with such a meeting; it's that I 
have recently been asked to participate in a project that needed to meet with 
the VP to clarify some review feedback . Or, in other words, it was a pretty 
pedestrian &quot;here's what we've come up with since the last time we met&quot; kind of 
meeting. What made it interesting was that it was with a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/blogs/ericr/">
Eric</a>.</p><p>Imagine a company run as a strict meritocracy that's one of the 
most important and profitable in it's industry. Now imagine that this company 
has been around for a while and has acquired tens of thousands of employees in a 
multi-layered hierarchy, with only the best and the brightest surviving and the 
best of the best rising to the top. That's MS. Billg is layer 1. Eric is at 
layer 4 w/ a small number of peers. I'm at layer 9 or, as I like to call it, 
&quot;the bottom.&quot; By all rights, that means that Eric should be &quot;5&quot; smarter than me, 
and I can see him fitting comfortably into that category.</p><p>Had Eric wanted 
to shred us, I'm sure he could have. Luckily, it was a nice, calm, productive 
meeting w/ him cutting quickly to the main points (in spite of the fact that he 
was reading and making notes on our handouts while still listening to our 
presentation). He also make some pretty interesting comments, especially 
considering how little time I'm guessing he's had to think about the problem 
space. At least one comment put me on a path that I like much better than the 
one I was on (although we'll see how he feels about it at the next review). The 
comment that startled me most, however, was when he said that he read my site. 
If this is my last post from inside the big house, you'll know how much he liked 
it. : )</p>
