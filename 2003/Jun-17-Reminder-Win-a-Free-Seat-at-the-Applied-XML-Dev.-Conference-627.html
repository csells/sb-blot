<h1>Reminder: Win a Free Seat at the Applied XML Dev. Conference</h1>
<a href="/614">Here</a>. Don't forget to help me rename my RSS feed and potentially win a free seat at the Applied XML Developer's Conference.

Even if you don't submit a contest entry, don't forget to reserve your spot at the conference! Seats are going fast and all three other DevCon's have sold out.
