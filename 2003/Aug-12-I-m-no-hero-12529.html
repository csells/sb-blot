<h1>I'm no hero</h1>
<p><i>
Tuesday, <span class="created">August 12, 2003</span></i></p><p>In <a href="#I_speak_for_the_trees">
yesterday's post</a>, I did not mean to imply that I was some kind of internal 
David against the MS Goliath. I am in the majority of employees when I say that 
I want to keep in mind what's best for the customer. The only issues, really, 
are what is best for the customer and how can those needs be met within the 
limits of our resources. We do spend quite a bit of time arguing over those, 
however. : )</p>
