<h1>My First .NET Show</h1>
<p>In many ways, 
my list of &quot;My First&quot; articles lately have been written out of duty to all of 
the developers that have always wanted to work at Microsoft, but haven't yet 
been able to. I first applied for a job @ MS as a summer intern in 1988. I was 
turned down while another guy down the hall of my fraternity was accepted. He 
spent all summer building LCD panels into one giant screen and I spent all 
summer writing FoxPro code. I wonder if he still works here. I can't for the 
life of me remember his name. David something...</p><p>Anyway, every time some 
new, fun, cool opportunity comes up, I feel like I have to take it just so that 
I can share it with the folks that don't yet work here (seems like they're 
hiring everyone, though, so it shouldn't be much longer : ). This time, I got to 
be in an episode of the .NET Show. I was to be 15 minutes of code demo after 
Brad Abrams and Anders Hejlsberg reminded folks that .NET wasn't just about web 
services. There were all kinds of folks that Robert had on tap to give the demo, 
but they were all busy, so eventually they got to the last monkey in the barrel 
and had to settle for me. : )</p><p>I flew up this morning and had to call MS 
information: &quot;Hi, I'm a Microsoft employee, but I'm new. Can you tell me where 
to go to get the MS Studios?&quot; This in spite of the fact that <a href="#My_First_Visit_to_MS_Studios">
I'd been there less than two weeks before</a>! (I'm terrible at remembering 
anything that doesn't have a lot of parenthesis and braces in it). They showed 
me to Green Room #2, where they had some food waiting, just like I was a real 
&quot;talent&quot;. Maybe the food was really for Brad and Anders. Maybe the food was for 
Nick Hodapp, Project Manager for Visual C++, who was in the makeup chair when I 
arrived. Nick was there to remind people that MS is serious about C++ both in 
the native and managed spaces and to show off <a href="http://www.vertigosoftware.com/Quake2.htm">
the port of Quake II to managed C++</a>.</p><p>While I waited my turn in the 
makeup chair, I watched Brad and Anders do their thing and made sure my demos 
worked. I was amazed that Robert never stopped the shooting while he did his 
interview. He did the whole thing in one take, which puts quite a burden on me 
to get my demo right the first time! I also spent some time eating the Green 
Room food, IMing my wife (she said to make sure not to use too much blue eye 
shadow or I'd look &quot;trashy&quot;) and giving the makeup artist a talk on the benefits 
of Wi-Fi (she asked, honest!).</p><p>After Brad and Anders were through, they 
wandered into my makeup session. I've always wanted to meet the creator of C#, 
but not while having my eyes done... Anyway, Brad and Anders were having a 
debate about the merits of a new optimization of the .NET framework and it was 
really cool to see how practical Anders was. I don't know why, but I imagined a 
guy that could come up with something as clean and simple as C# to be pretty 
academic. That wasn't the case at all. His view of the debate was that he wanted 
to see a few uses of a proposed new feature before he even thought about 
including it, as opposed to judging it on the basis of it's &quot;coolness&quot; as can 
happen when engineers gather together in groups. That brief chat made me feel 
better about having him in charge of my favorite programming language.</p><p>
After having just the right amount of blue eye shadow, I sat up on stage with 
Robert and Nick and <a href="#My_First_Visit_to_MS_Studios">my new friend Bob</a>, 
who ran the entire shoot. He was like the voice of God, being only heard and not 
seen from his control room in the bowels of MS Studio. He and I bonded quickly 
as we settled into the banter of trading insults familiar amongst the wiseasses 
of the world (now *that* sounds like a cool domain name! : ). Robert was very 
causal and very smiley, very different from the seriousness he portrays on film. 
Nick was very polished and gave such a compelling demo of the managed C++ Quake 
II port that I couldn't help but jump in and beg for more. I, on the other hand, 
said the word &quot;crack&quot; and mentioned my colleague as he IM'd himself onto my 
computer screen, both times making Robert roll his eyes at me (off camera, I'm 
sure). I also went off into la la land once when I answered a question that 
Robert hadn't asked, causing Nick to jump in with an answer.</p><p>All in all, 
having yourself filmed for posterity was pretty different from giving a talk. It 
was nice, because I had Nick and Robert to play off of and Robert was very good 
about moving things along. It was hard because, unlike a talk, there were things 
that I said that I wished I hadn't merely because they are permanent. Hopefully 
it went over well as a whole. I don't know if I'll be able to watch it myself. 
Someone please tell me how it is when it's published next month...</p>
