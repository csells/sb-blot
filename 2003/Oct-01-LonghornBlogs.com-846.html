<h1>LonghornBlogs.com</h1>
<a href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/">Here</a>. "LonghornBlogs.com is a community initiative to help spread the word with factual information about the next version of Windows, straight from the people that are building it. Because of this, the majority of people posting here (at least for now) will be Microsoft employees. Our intention here was to keep the signal-to-noise ratio extremely low. You won't find too many personal posts here, just good solid information about Longhorn."
