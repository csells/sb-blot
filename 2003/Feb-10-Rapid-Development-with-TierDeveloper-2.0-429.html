<h1>Rapid Development with TierDeveloper 2.0</h1>
<a href="http://www.alachisoft.com/overview.htm">Here</a>. From Zahid Iqbal: TierDeveloper is an object to relational mapping and code generation tool that lets you map middle-tier objects to your database tables, embed powerful SQL in them, and generate fully-working .NET (C# and VB.NET), Java and EJB components. It also generates a fully-functional ASP.NET and JSP application to let you test generated components, and design documents in HTML to cut down your learning curve.
