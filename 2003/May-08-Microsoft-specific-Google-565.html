<h1>Microsoft-specific Google</h1>
<a href="http://www.google.com/microsoft.html">Here</a>. I'm constantly amazed at how few people know about the Microsoft-specific Google site. The results almost always link back to somewhere on microsoft.com but the results seem to be somewhat more [cough] comprehensive than [sneeze] [rub eyes] MS's own search engine.
