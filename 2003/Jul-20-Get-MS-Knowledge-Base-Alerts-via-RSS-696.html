<h1>Get MS Knowledge Base Alerts via RSS</h1>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwanta/posts/10284.aspx">Here</a>. "If you haven’t heard of kbAlertz, it’s a website I setup to email me (and other subscribers) when Microsoft publishes new KB articles for their technologies. I’ve finally gotten around to exposing the Kbs as a RSS feed. Basically, pick the technology you want to subscribe to, and I’ll expose the latest 10 Microsoft Knowledge base articles as a RSS feed."
