<h1>Whidbey GC helps manage non-memory resources</h1>
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/BradA/permalink.aspx/bdfed2f9-f262-41b0-adec-740527711ef4">Here</a>. Brad Abrams describes how the Whidbey .NET Framework adds support for tracking unmanaged memory and limited resources of a non-memory nature. The former is handled by informing the GC of added "pressure" associated with unmanaged memory&nbsp;and the latter by exposing the private HandleCollector class that .NET 1.x has used for a while now. It's not reference counting, but it'll do for a start... : )
