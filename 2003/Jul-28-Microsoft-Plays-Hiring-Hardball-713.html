<h1>Microsoft Plays Hiring Hardball</h1>
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1204330,00.asp">Here</a>. "Like baseball's New York Yankees, Microsoft Corp. has been paying top dollar for top talent in an effort to dominate the new playing fields of XML and Web services."

While I agree that finally coming to work for Microsoft is like a baseball fan getting to play for the Yankees, I'm not sure where Darryl got his "top dollar" information. Maybe I should talk to the other guys about their deals... : )
