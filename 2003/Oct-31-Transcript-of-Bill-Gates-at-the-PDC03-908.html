<h1>Transcript of Bill Gates at the PDC03</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/speeches/2003/10-27PDC2003.asp">Here</a>. My favorite bit:

"Certainly we believe in this next wave, and we're not just saying that, we're showing with our investment level how sincere we are about that.  Over the last four years Microsoft's R&D budget has more than doubled, and that budget is focused on the things you're going to hear about today.  It's focused on making 'Longhorn' real, and all the milestones that get us to that point."
