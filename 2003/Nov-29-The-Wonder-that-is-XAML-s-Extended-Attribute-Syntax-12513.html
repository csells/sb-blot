<h1>The Wonder that is XAML's Extended Attribute Syntax</h1>
<p><i>Saturday, 
<span class="created">November 29, 2003</span></i></p><p>I've been playing with GridPanel today and really 
like how elegant it is. If I say the following:</p>
<pre>&lt;GridPanel&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;Testing&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;1&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;2&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;3&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
&lt;/GridPanel&gt;</pre><p>I get the equivalent of an HTML table with four rows with 
each SimpleText element forming a cell like so (augmented with Border elements 
not shown above to accentuate the cells):</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/xaml1.JPG" width="113" height="92"></p><p>
If I want to split the data into columns, I can do that using the Columns 
attribute:</p>
<pre>&lt;GridPanel <b>Columns=&quot;2&quot;</b>&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;Testing&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;1&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;2&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;3&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
&lt;/GridPanel&gt;</pre><p>Which gives me two rows of two columns each:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/xaml2.JPG" width="113" height="61"></p><p>
That's all nice and simple, but still flexible. For example, if I want to set 
the Testing string to cover two columns, I can give it an ID in the XAML and 
call the GridPanel.SetColumnSpan static method in code, e.g. when the Window 
loads:</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- xaml --&gt;
&lt;Window ... <b>Loaded=&quot;window1_Loaded&quot;</b>&gt;
  &lt;GridPanel Columns=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;SimpleText <b>ID=&quot;testingSimpleText&quot;</b>&gt;Testing&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
    &lt;SimpleText&gt;1&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
    &lt;SimpleText&gt;2&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
    &lt;SimpleText&gt;3&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;/GridPanel&gt;
&lt;/Window&gt;</pre>
<pre>// C#
<b>void window1_Loaded(...) {
  GridPanel.SetColumnSpan(testingSimpleText, 2);
}</b></pre><p>This code yields 3 rows arranged as follows:</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/xaml3.JPG" width="113" height="76"></p><p>
This is all fine and makes you appreciate the elegance of the GridPanel. 
However, that's not what inspired me to write this entry.</p><p>Remember that 
the SimpleText element serves as a cell in the GridPanel. Even better, the 
SimpleText element doesn't know it's serving as a cell in a GridPanel. The 
architecture of Avalon is loosely-couple so that all of the elements don't need 
to have intimate knowledge of each other. This loose coupling is really great 
for future elements that some developer wants to host in a GridPanel or that 
want to host SimpleText elements. Still, I'd like to be able to set GridPanel-related 
properties for each &quot;cell&quot; on the cell element itself, even if the cell element 
doesn't know it's a child of a GridPanel. And that's what the extended attribute 
syntax in XAML lets me do. Instead of writing the code, I can just do this:</p>
<pre>&lt;GridPanel Columns=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText <b>GridPanel.ColumnSpan=&quot;2&quot;</b>&gt;Testing&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;1&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;2&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
  &lt;SimpleText&gt;3&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
&lt;/GridPanel&gt;</pre><p>This dotted attribute syntax allows me to set a GridPanel 
setting for the SimpleText element w/o any knowledge from the GridPanel of the 
SimpleText or vice versa. That means that if I define the FooBar element 
tomorrow, I can set it's GridPanel.ColumnSpan on it when it's used inside a 
GridPanel w/o extending GridPanel. This also means that if FooBar has a Quux 
per-child property, I can set the FooBar.Quux attribute of the SimpleText 
element w/o extending SimpleText. Nice!</p><p>BTW, if you'd like to see the code 
that provides the GridPanel in &quot;outline mode&quot; as above, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><b>&lt;Border Background=&quot;black&quot; Width=&quot;100%&quot; Height=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
</b>  &lt;GridPanel Columns=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
<b>    &lt;Border Background=&quot;white&quot; GridPanel.ColumnSpan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
</b>      &lt;SimpleText &gt;Testing&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
<b>    &lt;/Border&gt;
    &lt;Border Background=&quot;white&quot;&gt;
</b>      &lt;SimpleText&gt;1&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
<b>    &lt;/Border&gt;
    &lt;Border Background=&quot;white&quot;&gt;
</b>      &lt;SimpleText&gt;2&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
<b>    &lt;/Border&gt;
    &lt;Border Background=&quot;white&quot;&gt;
</b>      &lt;SimpleText&gt;3&lt;/SimpleText&gt;
<b>    &lt;/Border&gt;
</b>  &lt;/GridPanel&gt;
<b>&lt;/Border&gt;</b></pre><p>Notice that the GridPanel.ColumnSpan is on the Border 
element, not the SimpleText element. That's because it's the Border that's the 
cell of the GridPanel, not the SimpleText.</p>
