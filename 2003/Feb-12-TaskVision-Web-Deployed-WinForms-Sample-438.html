<h1>TaskVision: Web Deployed WinForms Sample</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwinforms/html/wnf_taskvision.asp">Here</a>. TaskVision is a full-featured WinForms sample that supports auto-updating over the web and online and offline functionality, as well as some other cool .NET stuff. It includes most of the source for the client and the server as well as a lengthly write-up on just what makes it cool.

Worth checking out as an alternative to href-exes (TaskVision requires one install and auto-updates after that).
