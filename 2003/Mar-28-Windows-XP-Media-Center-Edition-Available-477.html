<h1>Windows XP Media Center Edition Available</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/resources/subdwnld.asp">Here</a>. For MSDN Universal subscribers, Windows XP Media Center Edition is available for download! This is huge for me because I've had a PC attached to my stereo/TV for years, but no apps to run it with. *Finally* MS decided to let folks get MCE w/o buying a whole new PC. Wahoo!
