<h1>XML For Humans</h1>
<p>When I sat down to write this piece, I didn't get 
why the work that <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx#nn2003-04-18T06:05:41Z">
Don, Gudge, KeithBa, Yasser</a>, <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/tewald/default.aspx#nn2003-04-09T08:33:08Z">
Tim</a> and <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/categoryview.aspx/BlogX">
ChrisAn</a> is doing is so amazing. I mean, I know that they're smart and I know 
that they're building the hell out of their stuff, but why? It seems like 
everyone that gets into blogging starts by writing their own blogging engine. 
It's like C programmers writing editors, C++ programmers writing string classes 
and XML programmers writing XSD&lt;-&gt;Class codegen. Sure, it's a useful learning 
tool, but earth-shattering? Worth that much energy from that many guys? When 
they're done, what great problems will be solved?</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I 
love the that the web makes it easy for anyone to not only publish but also get 
an audience. I also love that there's a protocol (RSS) that lets me subscribe to 
my favorite freelance authors in any one of dozens of tools (I'm into <a href="http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2003/04/06.html#000056">
SharpReader</a> today). I even like the Dear Diary style of writing because it 
leads itself to thoughts, feelings and insights that give me greater 
understanding of not only the topic but the author. As an added bonus, blog 
entries have turned into everything that's good about mailing lists w/o the 
endless angle brackets that remove the need to write in coherent sentences. 
Blogs feel like the kind of democracy we had that lead to the American 
Revolution when the world was re-shaped with big ideas, written by great 
authors.</p><p>But does the world need yet another blog engine? Personally, 
while it's primitive, I find that FrontPage have served me well as a blogging 
tool. The mental overhead is small, the development is nil and I get red 
squiggles. It falls down sometimes, but I've spent far less time maintaining the 
infrastructure for my content than I would if I were to build my own blogging 
engine.</p><p>On the other hand, while I don't feel the need for another 
blogging engine in the world, I definitely see value in what those guys are 
doing. Specifically, they're building apps, which is not something that XML guys 
are traditionally into. In fact, I'm scratching my head trying to think of 
another kind of XML-based technology that isn't infrastructure-based and I'm not 
coming up with one (even InfoPath is a dev-tool). Is RSS really the first 
mainstream use of XML that hasn't nothing to do with technology for it's own 
sake? Are blogs the killer app for XML? I know web services were supposed to 
fill that role, but while they do solve a real problem, they're not for 
consumers. My aunt in FLA couldn't make use of a web service. However, she could 
definitely subscribe to an RSS feed and read up on <a href="http://p.moreover.com/cgi-local/page?feed=237&o=rss">
the local news</a>, <a href="http://www.medscape.com/cx/rssfeeds/Nursing.xml">
her job</a> and <a href="http://www.growinglifestyle.com/h92/index.rss">
her hobbies</a>.</p><p>Of course, the beauty of having infrastructure guys 
building apps is that they get to put into practice what they preach. When stuff 
is a pain (like every single XML API ever invented and most XML vocabularies), 
they feel the pain. The difference between us and them is that instead of just 
wrapping a layer of abstraction around the ugly stuff like we have to, they can 
actually fix it. I started this piece wanting to shake those guys until they 
could tell me why they cared so much. How ironic that thinking through the 
issues in the very medium they're digging into helped me figure out what they 
were up to. The blog engine work is but the vehicle. They're riding the app 
train to enlightenment. They're trying to understand how XML can be used to 
solve problems for real humans. How can I argue with that?</p>
