<h1>Other ENTJs</h1>
<a href="http://www.typelogic.com/entj.html">Here</a>. In addition to ChrisAn and I, Harrison Ford is an ENTJ, as are FDR, Nixon, Steve Martin, David Letterman and Jim Carrey.

This is so true: "ENTJs are often 'larger than life' in describing their projects or proposals... In combination with the natural propensity for filibuster, our hero can make it very difficult for the customer to decline... Experience teaches many ENTJs that restraint may often be the better part of valor, lest one find oneself victorious but alone."
