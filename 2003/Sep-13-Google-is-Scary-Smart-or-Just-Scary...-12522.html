<h1>Google is Scary Smart, or Just Scary...</h1>
<p><i>Saturday, <span class="created">September 13, 
2003</span></i></p><p>When I was a kid, the source of universal knowledge at home was 
the set of dusty encyclopedias that my Mom inherited from somewhere. Today, it's 
the Internet, via Google. That in itself makes Google the fulfillment of most 
sci-fi novels' description of the the-store-of-all-human knowledge (I wish the 
text of all books were up, but that'll happen in time...).<br><br>Anyway, it 
didn't hit me just how comprehensive Google was 'til I typed in '&quot;Joe Grammer&quot; 
wife' yesterday (I was calling and wanted to be prepared to address his very 
nice wife by name in case she answered the phone). In 0.39 seconds, Google gave 
45 results, the 3rd of which contained Joe's wife's name! It was Joe himself 
who'd mentioned his wife's name in a mailing list post but still, that's pretty 
damn scary...</p>
