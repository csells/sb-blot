<h1>TeeGofer</h1>
<a href="http://www.steema.com/products/teegofer/index.htm">Here</a>. From Husein Choroomi: "TeeGofer is a tool designed specifically for the .NET Component writer. Written in 100% native C# code, it works by reflection to read in metadata from .NET Assemblies (.DLLs or .EXEs) to create first class quality online help documentation. The Tool is extremely easy to work with, presenting a tree navigator of the entire structure of any Assemblies selected for the Help Project."

Really Cool!
