<h1>Sealed Sucks</h1>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that the use of the &quot;sealed&quot; 
keyword in C# (and the concept in .NET) should almost never be used, at least on 
a class. Semantically, sealed applied to a class means that a class cannot be 
used as a base class. For example, the ImageList class from the 
System.Windows.Forms namespace is sealed:</p><font COLOR="#0000ff"><p><font face="Times New Roman">
public</font></font><font face="Times New Roman"> <font COLOR="#0000ff">sealed</font> <font COLOR="#0000ff">
class</font> System.Windows.Forms.ImageList : ... { ... }</font></p><p>What 
sealed means is that the designers of the ImageList class didn't take the time 
to test what would happen in all the scenarios where an ImageList is specified 
but a subclass is provided, e.g. MyImageListEx2. So, since they didn't test 
these scenarios, they're protecting developers from deriving from the ImageList 
base class when bad things might happen. They're also protecting developers if 
the base class changes radically in the future and derived classes no longer 
work.</p><p>Stop it!</p><p>I don't want to be protected in this way! Instead, I 
want to try to derive from ImageList and see if it works in the scenarios in 
which I'm interested. And if future versions of the ImageList base class break 
my derived class, I want to update my derived class in ways that work across 
versions of the base class or have two versions or whatever else I need to do to 
make it work. By making a class sealed, I just don't have any choice in the 
matter, which severely limits me in what I can do.</p><p>As an example, I think 
that the current ImageList implementation sucks in the following ways:</p><ul><li>
	Every time you need to edit an image, you need to remove the old image and 
	add it back again</li><li>Images are too small to see what they are</li><li>
	Can't tag images with names</li></ul><p>So, I'd like to build my own 
ImageList implementation that has the exact same programmatic interface, but 
that pulls images from manifest resources, fixing most of the issues above. All 
of the controls that take images get them from an ImageList type, so I need to 
provide my extra functionality in a type that's compatible with ImageList. 
However, the only way to do that in .NET is via inheritance and the damn sealed 
attribute disables my ability to do that! Instead, I have to build a custom 
component that's also an extender provider if I want to provide the same 
design-time usage as an ImageList and I have to tell developers using my image 
list component not to use any of the ImageList-related properties because it 
will conflict with mine. I literally can't package my functionality in a way 
that's developer-friendly in the same way as the ImageList and it's all because 
it's *sealed*!</p><p>Of course, the ImageList class isn't the only one. I had a 
solution to the problem of asynchronous method calls to web services from 
WinForms apps the other day (the problem is that an extra hop is always required 
to get back to the UI thread), but my solution can't work because the base 
delegate type required to make an asynch call is sealed. And the list goes on 
and on of things that I can't do because somebody is &quot;protected&quot; me from 
potential bad things.</p><p>Please, please, please, please, please don't mark 
your classes sealed. If you do, folks that want to provide extended 
functionality, and test to make sure that it works the way it's supposed to, 
don't even have the option. Type compatibility is a huge deal when you're 
dealing with class-based abstractions instead of interface-based abstractions 
and using the sealed keyword throws all of that away. The C++ community survived 
very nicely without sealed for a decade and it's made half of the classes on my 
site possible.</p><p>You took away my deterministic finalization. Must you also 
take away my ability to derive?</p>
