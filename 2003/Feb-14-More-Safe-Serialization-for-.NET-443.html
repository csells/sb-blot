<h1>More Safe Serialization for .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.dcooney.com/wiki/?PickleFramework">Here</a>. From Dominic Cooney: This library provides similar functionality to the .NET Framework's binary serialization (although unlike Chris Sell's SafeFormatter, it's not a drop-in replacement for the binary formatter; you have to implement an interface). It works on the .NET Compact Framework, and in downloaded code with only 'Internet' permissions. Unlike SafeFormatter, this library preserves the object reference graph.
