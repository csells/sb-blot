<h1>Feedster turns turbo!</h1>
<a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Here</a>. I don't know what happened, but suddenly Feedster rocks. It turned up 76 references to the Applied XML Developer's Conference in Google speeds. Plus, the Understanding Your Search section is just cool (although I don't really need to see it on every page of results : ).
