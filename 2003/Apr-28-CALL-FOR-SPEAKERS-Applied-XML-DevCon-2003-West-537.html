<h1>CALL FOR SPEAKERS: Applied XML DevCon 2003 West</h1>
<a href="/conference">Here</a>. Tentatively schedule for July 10-11 in greater Portland, OR, the Applied XML DevCon needs your talks. If you want to speak on XML applied in novel forms, e.g. web services, interop, extensibility, Google hacks, replacement for more traditional data formats, RSS, hardware integration, blogging, or in any other fun, cool, fast or amazing way, let me know! I'm looking for sessions on things that you're actually doing or planning on doing with XML. Strict theoreticians need not apply.

Send abstracts before 5/7 to csells@microsoft.com

If you can think of another place, e.g. mailing list or blog, that would be appropriate for this announcement, please send it along.
