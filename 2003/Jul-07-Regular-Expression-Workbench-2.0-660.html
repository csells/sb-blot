<h1>Regular Expression Workbench 2.0</h1>
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/EricGu/permalink.aspx/3eaf7ed2-d76b-427a-913c-79284e11e9cd">Here</a>. While I don't think it's as pretty, Eric Gunnerson's RegexW has some cool features I wish RegexD [1] had, like regex->English translation and menus for regex parts. Anyone want to merge the best of both into some uber regex tool?
