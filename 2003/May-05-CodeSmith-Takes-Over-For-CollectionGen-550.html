<h1>CodeSmith Takes Over For CollectionGen</h1>
<a href="http://www.ericjsmith.net/codesmith/">Here</a>. As of today, the functionality of CollectionGen has been sucked into Eric Smith's CodeSmith. I asked Eric to take on these features because CodeSmith does all of what CollectionGen does and more. All new feature requests/bug reports should go his way. Of course, feel free to continue to use CollectionGen as a model for VS.NET Custom Tools.
