<h1>I've got spurs...</h1>
<a href="http://members.tripod.com/~rosemck1/ive-got-spurs-that-jingle-jangle-jingle.mid">Here</a>. I'm walking down the hall this morning after a successful meeting in building 40. I'm wearing shorts 'cuz it's sunny in Seattle (!) and the shorts have 6 pockets, the two extras in front and below the two standard pockets.

Because I'm away from home, my pockets are filled with my wallet, cell phone, keys, a few days worth of change, my sun glasses and a PAA (Personal Analog Assistant) that I'm carrying. Since most of the stuff is in my lower pockets, I'm more sauntering than walking. Also, at each step, I jingle, because of the change and the keys, ching-ching-ching...

Then I realize that I'm humming. While this isn't unusual (I'm generally a happy fellow), after a few seconds, I realize the tune and bust out laughing. Follow the link for the tune...
