<h1>Dynamic Aspect-Weaving with .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/dcl/papers/GI2002.ps">Here</a>. From Hun Boon Teo: Another research paper from Wolfgang Schult and Andreas Polze, part of abstract: "Within this paper, we focus on dynamic management of aspect information during program runtime. We introduce a new approach called "dynamic aspect weaving" to interconnect aspect code and functional code. Using our approach, it is possible to decide at runtime whether objects living inside a compoent should be instantiated with support for a particular aspect or not. We have implemented our approach in contect of the langauge C# and the Microsoft .NET environment."
