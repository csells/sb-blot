<h1>Every Vain Author's Best Friend</h1>
<a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/arss.aspx">Here</a>. Rory built me an RSS feed to track book reviews on Amazon.com. And then he thanked me for letting him do it. You're welcome, Rory...

BTW, to complete your Vain Author's Toolkit, you'll need junglescan.com to track a portfolio of books' sales rank.

If those ain't web services, I don't know what are!
