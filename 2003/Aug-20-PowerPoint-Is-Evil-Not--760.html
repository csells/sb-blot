<h1>PowerPoint Is Evil (Not!)</h1>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html">Here</a>. I've seen this kind of argument before, blaming presentation software (or PowerPoint specifically) for making people stupid. If PPT didn't allow you to make intelligent presentations, then I'd be all for panning it, but that's not true. PowerPoint can be used for good or for evil, but it's only a tool; it's the presenter that decides the use to which the tool is put.
