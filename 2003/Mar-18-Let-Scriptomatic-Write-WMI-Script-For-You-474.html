<h1>Let Scriptomatic Write WMI Script For You</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/scriptcenter/wmimatic.asp">Here</a>. I learned more about what WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is and what it's for in 5 minutes running the Scriptomatic tool than anything I'd seen or read before. Plus, it's a great little ad hoc admin tool. Very cool.
