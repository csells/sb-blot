<h1>dotEASY</h1>

Abstract: "dotEASY" is a Visual Studio .Net Add-in that evaluates C# source code and performs "advices" in order to improve software quality. The configuration and programming of the "advices" is invisible to the developer, the toolâ€™s final user, who only requests for code evaluation. A new "advice" can be created defining metrics, thresholds and optionally programming validation classes and execution classes to automatically modify the code. The export and import capabilities allow one person to create an "advice", which can be configured and exported, so it can be used by many other people.
