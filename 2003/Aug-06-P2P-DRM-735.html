<h1>P2P + DRM</h1>
<a href="http://www.altnet.com/">Here</a>. I hesitate to blog this because you might not believe the "my friend" part, but my friend was just downloading some stuff with Kazaa and found a bunch of it tagged with DRM. Apparently AltNet is tagging porn content with Digital Rights Management and dropping it into peer-to-peer networks. When someone finds the AltNcontent in their search, downloads it and is asked to pay some small amount of money before consuming the content. What a great way to get your content out to folks and get paid for it! Why didn't the RIAA think of this instead of suing their customers into oblivion? Those porn guys are always way ahead of their time...
