<h1>Filter Files With Unknown Extensions For XP</h1>
<a href="/12418">Here</a>. The fact that Windows XP Find in Files only searches files with known file extensions drives me crazy because it skips, among other things, .cs  files. Every time I set up a new system, I have to re-figure out how to fix this. To facilitate that, I put together a .reg file that enable Find in Files to search all unknown file extensions as text files. Enjoy.
