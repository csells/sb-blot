<h1>Creating Doc-Centric Apps in WinForms, part 1 of 3</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms09182003.asp">Here</a>. This 3-part series really belonged as a chapter in my WinForms book, but after doubling the estimated size of the book (not to mention the amount of time it was supposed to take to write it), my publisher was anxious for me to stop writing.

For those folks accustomed to the document management support in MFC or for anyone that needs to build document-centric WinForms application, I think you'll like this series.

Part 1 discusses the basics of document management in SDI WinForms apps.

Part 2 discusses MDI apps and deeper shell integration.

Part 3 wraps most everything up into a reusable component, turning the construction of document management features in .NET largely into some drag-n-drop and some property browser settings. The resultant FileDocument component is available in the latest Genghis sources (although not yet in the release zip) @ http://www.genghisgroup.com

Enjoy.
