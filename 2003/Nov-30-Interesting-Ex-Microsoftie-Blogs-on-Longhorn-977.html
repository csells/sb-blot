<h1>Interesting Ex-Microsoftie Blogs on Longhorn</h1>
<a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com">Here</a>. I read a post yesterday that pointed at Wesner Moise, an ex-Microsoftie, and now I'm hooked. I'm enjoying how he applies his technical riguor to Longhorn. I also want to know about SoftPerson, his software company that "develops desktop applications based on AI." Subscribed.
