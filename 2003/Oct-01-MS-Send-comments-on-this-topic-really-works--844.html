<h1>MS "Send comments on this topic" really works!</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemthreadingmutexclassctortopic4.asp">Here</a>. If you see a little "Send comments on this topic" link, it launches an email to MS where you can complain about the docs, e.g. the .NET Mutex ctor. I had always ignored that link, thinking that I'd never get a response to email sent that way, but I was wrong. In fact, when one of the readers of my WinForms book [1] was trying to mix single-instance detection and no-touch deployment, he found that he couldn't. When he looked at the Mutex docs, they didn't list the appropriate permissions that creating a named Mutex requires. So he complained. And he got a response w/in 24 hours! And I got dragged into the ensuing conversation to fix the problem! I had *no* idea that little link would yield those kinds of results. Today I am proud to be a Microsoft employee. : )
