<h1>My Dad's All Set to Work At Microsoft</h1>
<p><i>Tue, <span class="created">Apr 22, 2003</span></i></p>
<p>My Dad, a long-time draftsman in a civil engineering firm in Fargo, ND, had 
this to say about manhole covers:</p>
<p>&quot;It's like this. Sanitary manhole covers are usually round (and solid, i.e. 
VERY heavy) but Storm sewer manhole and Inlet covers are usually square or 
rectangular grates which let water in. The deciding factor is where they are 
placed relative to the curb line. All covers are actually installed on a 
concrete generic 'Mexican Hat' structure which can be centered or offset to one 
side. The structure fits on the round concrete casting (5' - 8&quot; diameter) and 
can be made to accept any solid or grated casting. If this part of the world, 
where river flooding is fairly common, Sanitary manholes and lift stations are 
either raised above potential flood limits if possible or sealed and bolted 
shut, making them much more difficult to open. It's also a very good idea to 
vent Sanitary manholes and lift station with a portable fan to avoid being 
overcome by methane and other gasses trapped in them.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyone wonder where I got it? : )</p>
