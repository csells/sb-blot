<h1>Using GotDotNet Workspaces For Commercial Work</h1>
<p><i>Wednesday, <span class="created">July 23, 
2003</span></i></p><p>When I visit Redmond, I share an office with Andy Oakley, the PM 
for GotDotNet Workspaces. Workspaces was recently released from beta to v1.0 and 
when that happened, Andy sent around feedback from users.</p><p>Of course, folks 
love it in general (even some hard-to-please MS internals), but I was surprised 
to see to some folks were using private Workspaces for their team's main source 
code base. I shouldn't have been surprised; this makes a lot of sense. Private 
workspaces provide a protected space for file sharing, discussion, bug tracking 
and source code control. The last time I set up a commercial software 
development team, I needed weeks to get all of this picked out, installed and 
working and I needed an IT guy to keep it running and backed up. I remember 
hearing about a 3rd party that was going to bundle all of this together for a 
fee, but never got around to it. With Workspaces, MS already provides the whole 
team development environment, including VS.NET integration and a web interface, 
and it's free! Plus, with a private workspace, only folks on your team get 
access.</p><p>IMO, the only big piece that was missing from Workspaces was a way 
to pull down all of the source onto a build machine for regular automatic 
builds. For commercial work, this is key. So, Andy, tired of my whining, built <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=b3fb58ff-363b-4d0d-9f42-4946d86a19eb">
a command line tool for pulling down all source from a GDN Workspace</a> (and 
put it up in <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=b3fb58ff-363b-4d0d-9f42-4946d86a19eb">
it's own GDN Workspace</a>). Personally, I'd be slightly happier if it took 
arguments from the command line instead of a .config file, but that's easily 
added from <a href="http://www.genghisgroup.com">the Genghis 
CommandLineParser class</a> for those that are interested. Enjoy!</p>
