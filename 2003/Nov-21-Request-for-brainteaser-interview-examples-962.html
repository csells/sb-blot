<h1>Request for brainteaser interview examples</h1>
<a href="mailto:jkador@jkador.com">Here</a>. I was interviewed by John Kador yesterday about his upcoming book "How to Ace the Brainteaser Job Interview." At the end, he asked me for references to other folks that have had the experience of being asked or of asking brainteasers in interviews, so I'm posting his request:

I’m a Chicago-based business writer. 

My upcoming career book for 2004 is called How to Ace the Brainteaser Job Interview. It will be published by McGraw-Hill. The book is designed to help applicants think strategically about the puzzles, riddles, business cases that they may encounter in today’s job interview.

I’m looking for examples of puzzles, riddles, brainteasers, etc. and how they are used in the job interview.  I’d like to pepper the book with real-life anecdotes from people on both sides of the table. What puzzles do you like to ask and what do you look for? What are particularly elegant responses? From candidates, what questions were you asked and how did you handle them? Nothing will be attributed without permission. I’ll also be very generous with acknowledgments.

I welcome suggestions and questions at jkador@jkador.com. My web site is http://www.jkador.com.
