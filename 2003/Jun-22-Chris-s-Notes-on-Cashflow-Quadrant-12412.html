<h1>Chris's Notes on Cashflow Quadrant</h1>

		<p>Chris's Notes on
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446677477/chrissells">
		Cashflow Quadrant: Rich Dad's Guide to Financial Freedom, Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter, Warner Books, April, 2000</a>. I 
		recommend this book for the way it twisted my head around.</p>
		<p>There aren't any &quot;how to&quot; details in this book, but it still had some 
		pretty valuable ideas in it that really changed my thinking and inspired 
		me about what's possible:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are four main ways to make money: as an employee, being 
			self-employed, running a business and investing.</li>
			<li>Our society has trained the middle and lower classes that 
			success looks like getting a good job and being a good little 
			consumer. I'd long recognized the cycle of get into college-&gt;get a 
			good job-&gt;save for your kids' college education-&gt;they do it all over 
			again for their kids, but I didn't know what alternative I had.</li>
			<li>The alternatives, according to this book, are running a business 
			and/or investing. Specifically, this book really pushed running a 
			business to fund investments, mostly for the tax benefits. My own 
			thoughts are that having a business to fund investments is the 
			absolute right thing to do. However, having a business that 
			generates extra money to invest is easier said than done. If that's 
			your plan, you should go away and do that first, then figure out the 
			investing thing later in your leisure by the pool.</li>
			<li>Folks that run their own business or invest have a reasonable 
			chance for financial independence, whereas employees and the 
			self-employed do not.</li>
			<li>Financial independence has a specific definition: having more 
			passive monthly income than your monthly expenses. Only when's it's 
			passive income, i.e. you don't have to do the work to generate the 
			income, do your finances allow you to pursue whatever activities you 
			want, regardless of their income generating abilities, e.g. write a 
			novel or home school your kids.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In general, I really like the way that Kiyosaki writes, although it's 
		very marketing-style, so it turns me on and off at the same time. What I 
		like is that he writes in a very personal way, talking about his two 
		fathers, one trapped in the rat race like most of us and the other who'd 
		learned how to become financially independent. He uses examples of his 
		fathers' behavior to illustrate his points and talks a lot about how be 
		changed his own thinking to break himself out of the cycle.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, it seems like his major business is selling 
		financial education-related materials to fuel his own wealth, so right 
		away you have to suspect his motives. Also, his books are light on 
		details, although he's happy to use them to point you at other produces 
		that he or his partners have produced for more information. That's not a 
		business model that respects the needs or intelligence of his audience. 
		Still, if you ignore that and look for the ideas, I find his writing 
		useful.</p>
