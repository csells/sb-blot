<h1>Source Code to RegexDesigner .NET</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=01e0dfb7-0182-45cd-94f7-2ed2df2504a9">Here</a>. Due to popular demand, we've released the source code to RegexDesigner .NET in a GotDotNet workspace. We've also posted all the "issues" that we know about (and fixed the code generation problem), so this is a good release even if you're just a RegexD user. Enjoy.
