<h1>Apple's Music Store Needed for the other 94%</h1>
I'm very much looking forward to either <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/">iTunes</a> being available for Windows or someone else letting me purchase songs one at a time. In fact, as soon as that happens, my wife [ahem] owes the RIAA several hundred dollars in "back-fees" for "pre-downloaded" mp3s (she's always been very ahead of her time...)
