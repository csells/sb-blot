<h1>The Visual C++ Team Wants You!</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/search/results.aspx?FromCP=Y&JobCategoryCodeID=&JobLocationCodeID=&JobProductCodeID=10014&JobTitleCodeID=10255&Divisions=&TargetLevels=&Keywords=&JobCode=&ManagerAlias=&Interval=10">Here</a>. The VC++ team has a bunch of cool work they need doing and they're looking for candidates. Don't be shy. Apply today!

And if http://microsoft.com/jobs is too slow for you, feel free to send your resume and a bottle of Scotch (OK, that last part is optional : ) to Terry Leeper, a friend of mine on the VS team desperate for help: tleeper@microsoft.com.
