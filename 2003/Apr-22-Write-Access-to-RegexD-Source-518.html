<h1>Write Access to RegexD Source</h1>
<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=01e0dfb7-0182-45cd-94f7-2ed2df2504a9">Here</a>. I've had a bunch of requests for write access to the RegexD source. I provide read-only access to the RegexD source via a .zip file in the RegexD GotDotNet workspace. If you want write access, add your code to the snapshot of code in the workspace and send it to me for review. If it passes muster, I'll add you as a read/write member of the workspace.
This helps me to ensure that only good code makes it into RegexD. Thanks!
