<h1>Bill Gates' take on subjects from spam to Mozambiq</h1>
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2003-06-29-gates-interview_x.htm">Here</a>. I really like how BillG answers questions in general and this USA today interview covers lots of interesting ground, including BillG's take on spam, boring companies, Longhorn & Linux. Enjoy.
