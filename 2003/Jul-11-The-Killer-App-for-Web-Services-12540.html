<h1>The Killer App for Web Services</h1>
<p>
After watching Amazon's amazing presentation at the Dev.Conf., it hit me that 
Amazon.com is the killer app for web services. Not only are they technically 
cool, but they have two business models for themselves and their associates 
built right in:</p><ol><li>I can build a business on their back-end data, 
	selling targeted stuff to my customers, using their services to do all the 
	hard stuff on the back end</li><li>I can use their front-end to sell my own 
	products</li></ol><p>Amazon has turned the infrastructure on which they 
build their own business into a major revenue generator for not only themselves, 
but for associates. And, if they wanted to take it further, Amazon could provide 
all of their payment, distribution and storing/querying data as web services for 
things that weren't even available for sale on Amazon.com, e.g. medical supplies 
or porn, removing the need to build all of these services yourself. In fact, 
they're already planning on doing this for payment services.</p><p>*That's* what 
web services are supposed to enable. *Wow*.</p>
