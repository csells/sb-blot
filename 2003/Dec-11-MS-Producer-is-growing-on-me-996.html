<h1>MS Producer is growing on me</h1>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/technologies/producer.aspx">Here</a>. <P>OK, so Producer isn't perfect. For one thing, at least in <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/pdcmaterials/">the Longhorn PDC Presentations</A> on which I've been catching up, there's no fast forward or rewind, which is kind of annoying. Also, I've fallen in love with the Speed setting in WMP, so I miss that.</P>
<P>However, I had to reboot my machine to get VPN working today in the middle of a session, and when I starting <A href="http://microsoft.sitestream.com/PDC2003/CLI/CLI300_files/Default.htm">the Producer session for CLI300: Avalon: Building Applications with Controls and Dialogs</A> up again, it remembered where I was down to the second! That's pretty damn cool.</P>
<P>Of course, I've wasted all the time savings telling you people about it, but still... : )</P>
