<h1>Joel on Biculturalism</h1>
I've been completely unconnected for four days, so I'm sure that <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Biculturalism.html">Joel's essay on the differences in culture between Unix and Windows programmers</A> has been blogged to death, like most of Joel's essays. However, I was a Unix programmer for 4 years before becoming a Windows programmer, so this one really spoke to me. I especially like his description of how programs act under Unix so that they can communicate with other programs (success produces no output) vs. how they act under Windows so that they can communicate with people (success produces output). I don't know what I'm going to do with these new insights, but I'm enjoying them nevertheless.
