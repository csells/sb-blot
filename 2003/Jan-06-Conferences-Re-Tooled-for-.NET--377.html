<h1>Conferences Re-Tooled for .NET?</h1>
<a href="http://store.yahoo.com/sellsbrothers/pionofwinpho.html">Here</a>. From Chris Sells' Marketing Guy: The Pioneers of WinForms PhoneCon is a new method for attending Chris Sells's popular DevCons.
 
The whole unit can share a PC and speakerphone to attend a PhoneCon conference cheaper than 1 person can attend a regular conference.

PhoneCons are spread over 8 weeks to give you time to absorb the conference information, instead of having your head crammed full of too much information in just 1-2 days.
 
Best of all, you get to conduct conversations with leading .NET experts as well as your fellow attendees, offering a 'virtual hallway' before, during, and after each session!
