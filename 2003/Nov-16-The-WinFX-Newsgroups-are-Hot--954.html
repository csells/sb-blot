<h1>The WinFX Newsgroups are *Hot*</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/">Here</a>. If you have questions or comments about Longhorn/WinFX development, be sure to post them on one of the WinFX newsgroups. Digging through the recent activity, I'm hard-pressed to find a post that isn't addressed by a member of the appropriate MS product team. These guys are *dying* for your feedback, so post away!
