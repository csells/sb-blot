<h1>Infragistics UltraGrid for Avalon: Technology Demo</h1>
<a href="http://www.infragistics.com/presscenter/news/avalongrid.asp">Here</a>. How cool is this? Infragistics, UI component giant, has released a technology demo of their UltraGrid control for Avalon, including source!

Apparently it took 2 guys 1 month to build this control from a standing start, i.e. no previous Avalon experience. There are a bunch of limitations and Infragistics is clear that you shouldn't use this code as a template for writing your own components, but it's still fun to see. Thanks, Infragistics!
