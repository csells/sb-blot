<h1>Why is the taskbar at the bottom of the screen?</h1>
<a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/permalink.aspx/f3c5ba8a-1cfe-4c4c-83aa-f005d0d3524b">Here</a>. Raymond explains why the taskbar defaults to the bottom of the screen (because old apps would position themselves under it a lot when it was on top). Since I defected from the Mac, I always move mine to the top and like it, but did have problems for *years* about apps moving up under there.

For those few that still do, I've long since memorized the key sequence: Alt, Space, M, which flips a window into "Move Mode" and lets me use the arrows to move it down. I can understand why MS didn't want to teach everyone that and instead just put the taskbar at the bottom. : )
