<h1>Posting This from the Applied XML Dev.Conf.</h1>
<a href="/conference">Here</a>. I'm posting this using the wireless access from the room where the Applied XML Developer's Conference will be going on tomorrow (testing from the back to make sure it works). If I wanted to, I could plug into the readily available power as well. Very spiffy.

If you'd like to participate in the conference, head over to the conference home page for the link to the message board and post to your heart's content.
