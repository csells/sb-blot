<h1>My First Meeting with BillG's Technical Advisor</h1>
<p><i>Saturday, <span class="created">November 15, 2003</span></i></p><p>In my continuing quest to take advantage of unique 
experiences at Microsoft for those that aren't able to, I spent an hour in a 
meeting with Bill Gates's Technical Advisor, Alexander Gounares, earlier this 
week. Among other things, Alex is responsible for getting answers when Bill asks 
questions like &quot;Hey, what are we doing about adding air conditioning to 
Windows?&quot;</p><p>I've had meetings with senior execs at MS before and I always 
end up saying stuff that upsets them. This time, the guy was so nice, I just 
wanted to nod my head and do whatever he asked of me. In fact, the thing I 
volunteered to work on (a &quot;vision&quot; whitepaper exploring a new application of 
technology that's still under development) wasn't so much that he asked me to do 
it, but rather because he asked for a volunteer and made eye contact with me in 
such a heart-warming way that I couldn't say no. (Of course, my boss kicking me 
under the table didn't hurt, either... : )</p><p>BTW, in case you wondered, 
while the Sr. VP I upset knew me from my blog, Alex didn't know me from Adam. : 
)</p><p>For folks keeping track, in my six month career at MS, I gotten to do 
*lots* of cool stuff:</p><ul><li>Launch <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn">
	the Longhorn Developer Center</a></li><li>Hang out back stage at the PDC, 
	including preparing to act as Chris Anderson's demo understudy and helping 
	ship one of MSDN's new features (<a href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com">annotations</a>)</li><li>
	Write <a href="#submittingToBillgThinkWeek">a Think Week paper for BillG</a> 
	and receive his comments back on it</li><li>Meet Anders Hejlsberg, Eric 
	Gunnerson and Robert Hess</li><li>Have meetings with several execs, 
	including one Group VP, <a href="#myFirstVpMeeting">one Sr. VP</a> and 
	BillG's TA</li><li>Crash <a href="#myFirstApiReview">a WinFX API review</a></li><li>
	Introduce MS to the joy of <a href="/conference">a DevCon</a></li><li>Help 
	get <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/saraw/">my PUM 
	blogging</a></li><li>Invent <a href="#exposingRssComments">an extension to 
	RSS</a> that is getting fairly wide implementation, e.g. SharpReader, 
	RssBandit and .Text.</li><li>Appear on <a href="#My_First_.NET_Show">The 
	.NET Show</a></li><li>Get a few mentions in the press as an official MS 
	employee (including one that my Mom saw that made her very proud : )</li><li>
	Keep up contact with the community as much as I'm able via email, mailing 
	lists, newsgroups, articles, conference talks and appearances</li></ul><p>I 
list these not to brag, but to reflect on how many cool things there are to do 
at MS. I assume it's all down hill from here. : )</p>
