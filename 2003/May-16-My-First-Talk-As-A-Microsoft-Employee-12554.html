<h1>My First Talk As A Microsoft 
Employee</h1>
<p>On Wednesday, I gave my first 
talk as a Microsoft employee. I was told that the talk was for a bunch of UK 
folks that needed to be put on the .NET path and could I do 90 minutes on intro 
to WinForms in a conference room on campus? I can do intro to WinForms material 
for hours without preparation, so I didn't do any. Instead, I showed up with my 
laptop and plugged it into the overhead, where I then spent 10 minutes wrestling 
to get it out of suspend mode (the world needs faster hard drives!).</p><p>While 
my HD woke up (apparently jet-lagged from the trip between building 5 and 
building 43), I started warming up the crowd with questions &quot;How many of you are 
C++ programmers? How many VB programmers?&quot; The room was split pretty evenly 
between C++ and VB, taking half of my jokes away (I'm happy to make fun of 
either C++ or VB programmers equally, but it's less fun when only half the room 
laughs). Plus, these guys were *way* jet lagged, so getting them to even keep 
their eyes open in the afternoon after they'd arrived was a challenge, let alone 
getting them to laugh or even engage.</p><p>And then, because my HD was still 
shaking off the dust, I asked &quot;Did you hear anything good today?&quot; Predictable, 
they said that they'd like the story of web services (Don had been there earlier 
in the morning) and that caused me to launch into my rendition of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms05202002.asp">
how WinForms + Web Services provided a wonderful way to keep all of the UI logic 
on a single machine</a>, as opposed to web applications, where the UI is split 
between the client and the server. They weren't biting.</p><p>Plus, after diving 
into some WinForms intro material and having it fall flat (anchoring and docking 
normally wows 'em), I did a bit of deeper digging into my audience. It turns out 
that most of them were old hands at WinForms, throwing my planned material right 
out the window. Luckily, I did find a topic that they're weren't familiar with: 
href-exes. So, I did <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/07/NetSmartClients/default.asp">
my normal href-exe shtick</a> for about 60 minutes, getting them to wake up, ask 
questions and even laugh a bit at my witty repartee.</p><p>Thinking I was in the 
clear, I opened the floor for questions. Of course, the first question they 
asked was the same question I'd have asked if I were in their shoes (as I so 
often was <a href="#boldBeginning">until about a month ago</a>), &quot;What's new in 
WinForms 2.0?&quot; And that's where things got shaky again. I had some ideas of 
where WinForms 2.0 was going in the next release of .NET, but nothing concrete 
(I've been buried in Longhorn and a whole new culture too deep to dig into 
WinForms futures yet). Plus, even the things that I did know, I had no idea what 
I could say. Where these guys under NDA? What could I say to them if they were? 
What can I say to them if they're not? Even if I'm not supposed to say anything, 
I want them to like me (every speaker's guiding principle) and I wanted to say 
something besides &quot;I know, but I'm not going to tell you. &lt;bpffffft&gt;!&quot;</p><p>So, 
I stammered out what I knew to be some WinForms desires without making any 
promises on their behalf and hoping no one would ever know (except my closest 
friends reading this spout entry : ). It wasn't a happy experience. I should 
have talked with the WinForms guys before my talk so I knew what I could say 
about the future. Rookie mistake #1.</p><p>Rookie mistake #2: In an effort to 
stay open to these guys, I wrote my alias on the flipchart and then, while I 
filled in the domain, kept answering questions. When I looked back at the 
flipchart, I discovered that I'd written &quot;csells@sellsbrothers.com&quot;. Doh! Since 
it was a flipchart and not a whiteboard, I couldn't even erase it. &lt;sigh&gt;</p><p>
All in all, I think I got them jazzed about href-exes, but it was definitely not 
my finest talk. Luckily, it was internal and to a small group; I would have been 
mortified to have given that performance at a larger venue. Plus, making fun of 
VB programmers isn't fun anymore. I mean, they're customers, too. Looks like I'm 
going to need some new material...</p>
