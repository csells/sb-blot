<h1>PDC Pre-Con Tutorial: Windows Forms</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/events/pdc/precon.aspx">Here</a>. I don't think I've mentioned it here, but I'm really looking forward to the Windows Forms pre-conference tutorial I'm giving with Rocky Lhotka at the PDC. I've never spoken at a PDC before but it'll be just like old times with Don, Tim and Martin down the hall.

Also, I've never spoken with Rocky before, but he's also a big Midwesterner with a strong opinion, so it should be fun. Plus, he prefers semi-colonless languages, so all kinds of sparks should fly as I attempt to convert him to the one, true way and he does the same to me. We may have trouble remembering there's an audience. : )
