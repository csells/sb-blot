<h1>The Business of Software</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/business/default.aspx">Here</a>. One of the major goals of Windows has always been to provide a platform on which ISVs and shareware authors can make money and on which corporate developers can save money.

Towards that end, I've set up an experimental section of the Longhorn Developer Center called "The Business of Software." It's aimed at collecting resources related to Windows business issues.

Check it out and let me know what else you'd like to see there.
