<h1>What Is An RSS Feed?</h1>
<p>As a 
deadline nears and I spend an increasing amount of time avoiding the work I 
should be doing, I find a finance geek acquaintance of mine asking what an RSS 
feed is after I implored him to add one to <a href="http://www.lahiji.com/">
his web site</a>. This is a 20-year old that's <a href="http://www.lahiji.com/pages/bio.shtml">
owned stock since he was 11</a>, <a href="http://www.lahiji.com/pages/bestreports.shtml">
read 12,000 company reports in 2002</a>, <a href="http://www.lahiji.com/">
earned 155% on his money is the last <b><i>11 months</i></b></a><b><i> </i></b>
and <a href="http://www.lahiji.com/archives/1063147097.shtml">
recently been given his own $35M mutual fund to manage</a> (becoming the 
youngest ever mutual fund manager). If <i>this</i> guy doesn't know what an RSS 
feed is, then I'm guessing at least some of my readers don't know either (yes, 
I'm talking to you, Mom). When he asked me what an RSS feed was, this is what I 
told him:</p><p>An RSS feed is a thing of pure beauty. If you've ever been to a 
web site with an orange XML or RSS button, clicking it will yield a page that 
looks something like this:</p><div class="e"><span class="m">&lt;?</span><span class="pi">xml

While RSS is fairly unreadable for normal humans, computers eat it up. For 
example, if you read the RSS feed from my site on a regular basis, whenever I 
make a new post, you'll see a new entry in the RSS feed. RSS feeds aren't useful 
for you, but when fed to an &quot;RSS reader&quot; program, you can keep up to date on 
literally hundreds of web sites without having to browse to them manually. The 
RSS reader will check each RSS feed to which you subscribe, letting you know 
when something new on a web site has happened and showing you what it is, giving 
you the option to follow up or ignore the new thing. Thousands of sites have RSS 
feeds, letting me keep up on a bunch of things:</p><ul><li>My friends' writings</li><li>
	Global and financial news</li><li>People talking about topics of interest to 
	me, like my favorite technologies or my latest book</li><li>My favorite 
	comics strips (I need my daily Dilbert!)</li><li>The latest product and 
	articles releases from Microsoft</li><li>Practically anything else I care 
	about on a regular basis</li></ul><p>I keep up on all of this without ever 
visiting the web sites themselves them 'til something of interest catches my 
eye.</p><p>There are a bunch of RSS readers in the world, but <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net">
my favorite is SharpReader</a>. If you install this program and start it up, SR 
will check all of the RSS feeds that you subscribe to on a regular basis in the 
background while you work, notifying you of something new by changing it's icon 
from blue to yellow. If you decide to install SharpReader, your next stop should 
be <a href="http://www.newsisfree.com">NewsIsFree.com, where 
you'll find all kinds of RSS feeds in any number of categories</a>. After 
subscribing to a few of those, you'll want to stop by <a href="http://dwlt.net/tapestry/">
Tapestry, where you can find RSS feeds for tons of daily comic strips</a>. If 
you want to get fancy, you can go to <a href="http://www.googlealert.com/">
GoogleAlert, where you can subscribe to searches</a> so that whenever Google 
finds something new on your search topic, your RSS reader will let you know.</p><p>
If you find the ability to track hundreds of web sites without surfing to each 
of them manually, RSS is for you. If you find my instructions intimidating, ask 
a computer friend to help you out (I'll be home for Christmas, Mom).</p>
