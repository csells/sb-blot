<h1>Xamlon samples look interesting</h1>
<P>If you haven't seen it, Xamlon is a .NET 1.1 implementation of Longhorn's XAML. And while I was under the impression that it was just XAML, i.e. a language for declaring and defining objects, it looks like Xamlon is an attempt to implement Avalon, too. I haven't downloaded it, but looking at <A href="http://66.27.62.90/docs/samples.htm">the Xamlon samples and code online</A>, it looks like a subset of Avalon. Interesting...</P>
