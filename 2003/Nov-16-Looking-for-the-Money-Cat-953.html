<h1>Looking for the Money Cat</h1>
<a href="/12410">Here</a>. Someone sent me a fabulous follow up email to "The Average Return Myth," but in the heat of the PDC, I didn't get a chance to read it and now that the PDC is over, I can't find it again! All I remember is that the person's email address started with "cat" (I think). Can you please send it again, Mr. Cat? Thanks!
