<h1>Agilitrain: Model Driven Development with Oslo</h1>
<P>Holy cow -- another <A href="https://agilitrain.com/Workshop/Info/Model_Driven_Development_with_Oslo">Oslo course, this one from Agilitrain</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Microsoft's Oslo is trying to change the way that software is designed, developed and delivered. They are introducing a platform for building real, scalable and manageable model-driven applications. Being an early adopter of this platform will prepare you for our changing world.</EM></P>
<P><EM>"This course will show you how to build models and domain specific languages and use them all at runtime using the Repository to create great applications for your users."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'm a huge <A href="https://agilitrain.com/Workshop/Info/Model_Driven_Development_with_Oslo">Shawn Wildermuth</A> fan (Shawn's the author of this course and the instructor). Recommended.</P>
