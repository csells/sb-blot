<h1>I'm speaking at VSone in Munich, Feb 11-12</h1>
<P>I'm giving two talks on model-driven development at <A href="http://www.vsone.de/">VSone in Germany in Feb this year</A>: the keynote and a dive into Oslo. If you're in the neighborhood or are looking for a party spot, drop on by!</P>
<P>I'm even going for an extra few days to see the sights -- hopefully it won't be too cold. I'm from the Midwest and all, but when it's cold there, we stay home. I want to go out! Any suggestions for what I should oughta see?</P>
