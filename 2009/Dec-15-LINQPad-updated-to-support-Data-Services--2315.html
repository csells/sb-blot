<h1>LINQPad updated to support Data Services!</h1>
<IMG align=right src="http://www.linqpad.net/DataServices.png"> 
<P>Joe Albahari, the author of LINQPad, has added support for <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/bb931106.aspx">WCF Data Services</A> to <A href="http://www.linqpad.net/Beta.aspx">the 1.37.1 version beta</A>&nbsp;of LINQPad. This means that you can point LINQPad at any <A href="http://www.odata.org/">Open Data (OData)</A> endpoint and do queries interactively just like any other LINQ data source. He even supports HTTP security, in case the endpoint in question requires it. Further, if you have your own custom LINQ to Whatever and you'd like to plug a connection to it into LINQPad, Joe has already added the ability to create a custom data context provider. It is, as they say, a thing of beauty. Enjoy!</P>
