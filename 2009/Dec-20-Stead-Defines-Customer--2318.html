<h1>Stead Defines 'Customer'</h1>
<P>And here's one more from the paper file I'm putting into electronic format to reduce the pile of papers in my life:</P>
<P>During the all-associate broadcast, Jerre Stead shared with the team a memo another associate had sent about defining a customer. Here are the highlights:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Customers are individual companies with unique needs.</LI>
<LI>Customers are struggling with their competitors for success.</LI>
<LI>Customers are people with feelings and opinions, therefore relationships and experiences matter.</LI>
<LI>Customers will judge us by our performance, not by our words.</LI>
<LI>Customers are influenced by every contact with us, each and every day.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Customer "Must Not's"</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>We must not import our products or ideas on customers.</LI>
<LI>We must not ask customers to deal with people who cannot make decisions.</LI>
<LI>We must not make customers wrestle with our bureaucracy.</LI>
<LI>We must not allow any question, issue or awkwardness go unattended or unresolved.</LI>
<LI>We must never unpleasantly surprise our customer.</LI>
<LI>We must never, never take a customer for granted.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Customer "Can's"</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>We can help the customer succeed - make our customers winners.</LI>
<LI>We can provide greater value to our customers than our competitors can.</LI>
<LI>We can measure ourselves from the viewpoint of our customers.</LI>
<LI>We can put decision-making close to our customers.</LI>
<LI>We can continuously improve to better serve our customers.</LI></UL>
