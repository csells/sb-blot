<h1>Did you register for the DSL DevCon and not hear back?</h1>
<P>Apparently even more people have registered for <a href="/public/conference/">the DSL DevCon</A> than I thought. If you've sent a registration notice and having heard back from me, then you aren't registered. Please <a href="/public/conference/#Sign_Up!">register again</A> or email me directly: <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com">csells@microsoft.com</A>.</P>
