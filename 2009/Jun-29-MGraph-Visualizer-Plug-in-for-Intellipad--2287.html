<A href="http://www.sixpairs.com/">Ceyhun Ciper</A> is at it again, this time taking advantage of the Intellipad plug-in capabilities in <A href="http://msdn.com/oslo/">the "Oslo" May 2009 CTP</A> and adding <A href="http://www.sixpairs.com/mgplugin.aspx">real-time "M" visualization as you type</A>. This is a wonderful way to see both the textual and graphic abstract symbol tree of your data as you type it. Keep up the good work, Ceyhun!
