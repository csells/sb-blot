<h1>DSL DevCon Pre-registration</h1>
<P>There's been such a flood of <A HREF="/public/conference/">DSL DevCon</A>&nbsp;<A HREF="/public/conference/">talk proposals</A> that I've had a hard time keeping up (although feel free to <A HREF="/public/conference/">let those nice folks in Eclipse, XML,&nbsp;Java and Unix land</A> if you know who they are!).</P>
<P>Also, there's been a huge amount of interest in attending the conference itself and some folks even worry that the conference will sell out before they can register (the first five DevCons have all sold out and those cost money!), so they've been asking me to put 'em on a list. I'm still working out the logistics with the nice Lang.NET folks, but <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=DSL DevCon Pre-registration">if you'd like to pre-register for the DSL DevCon, drop me a line and I'll put you on the list</A>. It will be my job to make sure that anyone that pre-registers gets to go.</P>
<P><a href="/public/conference/">Tell a friend!</A></P>
