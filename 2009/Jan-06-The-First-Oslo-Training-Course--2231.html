<P><EM>Since the release of .NET 3.0, Microsoft has been actively engaged in an internal initiative to unify their services and modeling technologies. The result is a new modeling platform -- codename "Oslo". To summarize, "Oslo" makes it possible to move from a world where models describe the application to a world where models are the application. The technology to deliver this new set of capabilities will be delivered through future versions of BizTalk Server, System Center, Visual Studio, .NET Services and the .NET Framework. Come get a "first look" at this ambitious effort and see what's available today!</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Enjoy.</P>
