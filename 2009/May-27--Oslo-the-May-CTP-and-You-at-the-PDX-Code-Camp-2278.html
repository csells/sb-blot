<h1>"'Oslo', the May CTP and You" at the PDX Code Camp</h1>
<P>I'll be speaking at <A href="http://portlandcodecamp.org/">the Portland Code Camp</A> on Saturday, May 30th, just as <A href="http://msdn.com/oslo/">the May CTP of "Oslo"</A> is hot off the presses:</P>

<P><EM>As you may or may not know, "Oslo" is also a place. However, we're not going to talk about that. Instead, Chris Sells, a member of the technical staff on the Microsoft "Oslo" team, is going to give you a quick intro to "Oslo," including "M" and Quadrant, taking you end-to-end on a few real-world-ish examples and then wave his hands furiously about the rest, begging you to give it a try and&nbsp;complain loudly and often so we can get it right before we ship v1.0.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Come one, come all! Bring a friend and get a free GUID!</P>
