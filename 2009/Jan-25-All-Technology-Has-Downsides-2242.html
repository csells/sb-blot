<h1>All Technology Has Downsides</h1>
<P>Rocky makes some good points in his recent piece on DSLs (<A class=TitleLinkStyle href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/DSLsNdashFunCoolButMaybeABadIdea.aspx" rel=bookmark>DSLs &#8211; fun, cool, but maybe a bad idea?</A> ) -- basically, who's going to learn the DSL when the folks that know it move on? That's one potential downside of the proliferation of DSLs and I could give you more.</P>
<P>However, all technologies come with these downsides, e.g. </P>
<UL>
<LI>Managed environments make new programmers forget what's under the hood (and in some cases, actually afraid to look).</LI>
<LI>Horseless carriages produce pollution.</LI>
<LI>iPhones are killing the English language by encouraging the use of "words" like "lol," "afaik" and "wtf."</LI>
<LI>Airplanes crash.</LI>
<LI>Very very bad code written in Visual Basic can still do the right thing.</LI>
<LI>Fonts let every letter look like a ransom note.</LI>
<LI>etc.</LI></UL>
<P>The point isn't whether a technology has downsides or not -- of course, it does. The point is whether the upsides outweigh the downsides. In the case of DSLs and model-driven development all up, the "Oslo" team is making a big bet that we can make you overall more productive when digging ourselves out of the IT software backlog hole. Will we be? I think so, but we have a lot of work to do before we'll know for sure.</P>
<P>And how do we reduce the impact of the downsides of a new technology? By knowing that they're there, which is why <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/DSLsNdashFunCoolButMaybeABadIdea.aspx">Rocky's commentary</A> is so useful. Recommended.</P>
