<h1>Twitter takes a bite out of blogs</h1>
<IMG align=right src="http://twitter.com/images/twitter.png"> 
<P>At the last DevCon in 2003, blogging was rampant. We had about 100 posts in the lead up to the conference and during the conference itself.</P>
<P>A this year's <a href="/conference">DSL DevCon</A>, there's a ton of buzz, but almost none of it is in the blogosphere. Instead, it's all in Twitter.Last I checked, it was <A href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23dsldevcon">more than 150 tweets</A> and we're still on the first talk of the 2nd day (and day #1 was only a half day).</P>
<P>The worm has turned.</P>
