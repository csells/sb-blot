<h1>Win7 killed a feature I love in Vista!</h1>
<IMG align=right src="/public/spout/searchtheinternet.jpg"> 
<P>All my friends have updated to Windows 7. My 14-year old son is running Win7. I'm the only one I know that's not running Windows 7. The reason? Windows 7 took away a feature I use all the time, as shown on the right: Search the Internet.</P>
<P>Here's what I do all day, every day in Vista: Ctrl+Esc to bring up the Start menu, then I start typing. If I'm searching on my HD, I immediately get matches and I can choose one with just the arrows and the Enter key. If I'm typing in the name of a program in the Start menu, I get those matches and choose one. If I want "calc" or "notepad" I can just type those and those work.</P>
<P>However, 80% of the time, I want to search the internet, so enter my search term, optionally including attributes like "site:", I press, down-arrow once, highlight "Search the Internet" and press Enter. This brings up my default browser with my search results in my default search engine without me having to move the mouse or open the browser and wait for the home page or even decide where I want the search results to come from until after I've entered my search phrase.</P>
<P>And they took it out of Windows 7. : (</P>
<P>I logged the bug and heard nothing.</P>
<P>Does anyone know of I 3rd party program I can run that will work exactly like the Vista Start menu under Windows 7? Please?</P>
