<h1>Martin Fowler on DSL Migration</h1>
<P>Martin, who has recently agreed to be the keynote speaker for <a href="/public/conference/">the DSL DevCon</A>, has a nice piece on <A href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DslMigration.html">DSL migration strategies</A>.</P>
<P>While Oslo has no direct support for the incremental migration strategy to migrate DSL documents forward, we absolutely provide the tools for building it yourself. We do have very nice support for model-based migration, which keeps a parser around for each version of the DSL and produces the same underlying semantic model (which we call MGraph).</P>
