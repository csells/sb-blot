<h1>Preview of Doug's "M" RESTful Services Talk at Mix</h1>
<P>Scott Hanselman got a preview of the talk that Doug is giving at Mix this year on RESTful services using "M", took some screen shots and did <A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MixGettingMyHeadAroundOsloMAndMGrammar.aspx">a nice write-up</A>. Worth a quick look-over even if you're coming to the talk (which will be a hoot -- I'll be carrying Doug's bags on this one : ).</P><IMG src="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GettingmyheadaroundOsloMandMGrammer_C5C9/7_thumb.png">
