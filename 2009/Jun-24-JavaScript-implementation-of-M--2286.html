<h1>JavaScript implementation of "M"</h1>
<A href="http://diakopter.blogspot.com/">Matthew Wilson</A> is pushing "M" into the land of browser client-side scripting with his partial (but growing!) JavaScript implementation, as seen in <A href="http://jsmeta.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bin/JSMetaPad.html">his web 3-pane "M" grammar mode</A> ala Intellipad. It's work like this that could make "M" a cross-platform solution for languages as well as data types and values. Good job, Matt!
