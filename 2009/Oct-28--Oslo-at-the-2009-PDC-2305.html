<h1>"Oslo" at the 2009 PDC</h1>
<P>Lars Corneliussen, my friend and "Oslo" consigliere, has posted a nice update on what he's guessing "Oslo" might or might not be: <A href="http://startbigthinksmall.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/updates-on-what-oslo-is-and-quadrant-not-is-september-2009/">Updates on what Oslo is and Quadrant not is (September 2009)</A>. The fact that he has to guess points to just how early we are in the development cycle. For our latest thoughts, I recommend <A href="http://microsoftpdc.com">the PDC 2009</A>, where you should attend all of the following talks:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/P09-04">Data Programming and Modeling for the Microsoft .NET Developer</A>, Don Box, Chris Anderson</LI>
<LI><A href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT10">Evolving ADO.NET Entity Framework in .NET 4 and Beyond</A>, Shyam Pather, Chris Anderson</LI>
<LI><A href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT12">ADO.NET Data Services: What&#8217;s new with the RESTful data services framework</A>, Pablo Castro</LI>
<LI><A href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT50">Building Data-Driven Applications Using Microsoft Project Code Name "Quadrant" and Microsoft Project Code Name "M"</A>, Douglas Purdy, Chris Sells</LI>
<LI><A href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT34">Microsoft Project Code Name &#8220;M&#8221;: The Data and Modeling Language</A>, Jeff Pinkston, Don Box</LI>
<LI><A href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVR19">Microsoft Project Code Name &#8220;Repository&#8221;: Using Metadata to Drive Application Design, Development, and Management</A>, Shoshanna Budzianowski, James Baker</LI>
<LI><A href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVC28">The 'M'-Based System.Identity Model for Accessing Directory Services</A>, Gert Drapers, Kim Cameron</LI></UL>
<P>Personally, I'm very much looking forward to this PDC. I get to give what I'm sure is the talk with the longest title, but even better, I get to see friends, old and new, and I love listening to good talks on technologies I just don't have the time to dive into any other time.</P>
<P>If you're going to PDC and you'd like to chat, <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Meet me at the PDC!">drop me a line</A> and we can set up some time. See you there!</P>
