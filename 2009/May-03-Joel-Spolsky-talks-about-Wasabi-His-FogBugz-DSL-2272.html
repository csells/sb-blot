<h1>Joel Spolsky talks about Wasabi: His FogBugz DSL</h1>
In Scott Hanselman's April 2009 podcast, <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=176">Visiting Fog Creek Software and Joel Spolsky</A>, Joel talks about <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01b.html">Wasabi, FogCreek's VBScript compiler</A>, and he talks about it really being a subset of VBScript used specifically for bringing <A href="http://fogbugz.com">FogBugz</A> to Unix and the CLR. In fact, it's a VBScript compiler built specifically to compile a single application, doing things like making the 5% of ADO.NET they use cross-platform. And just in case the point isn't completely obvious, Joel and Scott draw the conclusion for us: Wasabi is the domain-specific language just for FogBugz. Just another DSL in nature.
