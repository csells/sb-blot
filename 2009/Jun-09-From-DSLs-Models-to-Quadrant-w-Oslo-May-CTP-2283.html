<h1>From DSLs & Models to “Quadrant” w/ “Oslo” May CTP</h1>
Dana Kaufman, a PM on the extended "Oslo" team, has been blogging a series of articles on <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dkaufman/archive/2009/05/27/from-dsl-and-models-to-quadrant-using-oslo-may-ctp-part-i.aspx">the definition of a set of "M" types</A>, <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dkaufman/archive/2009/06/05/from-dsls-and-models-to-quadrant-using-oslo-may-ctp-part-ii.aspx">the associated "M" language definition for a domain-specific language (DSL)</A> and concluding in how that data can be visualized and manipulated in "Quadrant" (the first two parts are available now and the third is coming). Enjoy!
