<h1>Chris Sells on .NET Rocks! talking about data</h1>
I was on <A href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=494">.NET Rocks! recently talking to Richard and Carl about data</A> in Visual Studio (object-oriented, XML and relational), what tools Microsoft is already providing for managing your SQL Server schema and data migration and&nbsp;where "Oslo" ("M", "Quadrant" and the Repository)&nbsp;fits into the overall picture. It was fun and I think it turned out well. Enjoy.
