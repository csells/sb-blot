<h1>"M" For Language Definition in November 2009 CTP</h1>
<P>I couldn't wait for the PDC, so I posted <A href="/12647">a screen shot of my favorite new three features of "M" for defining domain-specific languages (DSLs)</A> in the November 2009 CTP of "Oslo":</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left><STRONG>Expressions on the right-hand side</STRONG> in language actions to calculate&nbsp;results. "M" supports a rich expression syntax for a variety of data types.</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><STRONG>Data conversion</STRONG> <STRONG>functions</STRONG> for output, one for each of the supported "M" data types.</P>
<LI>
<P align=left><STRONG>DSL debugging mode</STRONG> to let you step through your input data and debug your language.</P></LI></UL>
<P align=left>I can't wait for you to <a href="/12647">see it</a>!</P>
