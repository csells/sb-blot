<h1>Flinging My 60-year-old Mother High Into The Air</h1>
<P>My mom came to visit to celebrate my 40th birthday and her 60th birthday. She and the Sells Brothers and I spent yesterday afternoon wandering along the waterfront, checking out <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serval">exotic animals</A>, ditching <A href="http://www.comedytricks.com/">lame cowboy comedians</A> and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_dough">eating elephant ears</A>. And then, to put a point on the day, we launched ourselves 100 feet into the air on a giant bungle cord machine.</P>

<P>As part of this, my eldest son decided at the peak of our arch to spit in spite of my objections. You can see in the video us reacting to our falling at the same rate at his glob of saliva which is the clearest demonstration of <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo's_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment">Galileo's gravity experiment from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa</A> that I've ever seen.</P>
<P>Enjoy. We did. : )</P>
