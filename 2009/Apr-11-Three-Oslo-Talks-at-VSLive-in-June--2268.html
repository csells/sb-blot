<h1>Three "Oslo" Talks at VSLive in June!</h1>
<P>This year's <A href="http://vslive.com/2009/lasvegas/default.aspx">VSLive in Las Vegas (June 8-11)</A>, has <A href="http://vslive.com/2009/lasvegas/oslo.aspx">three, count 'em three, "Oslo" talks!&nbsp;(And a Dublin talk to boot.)</A> Just a few months ago, the "Oslo" team was giving all the talks and now there are so many of them I have to hear about them on the street! Our baby grew up so fast...</P>
<P>And as if that weren't enough, Jon Flanders gave me a code for a discount:</P>

<P><EM>"If you register with code S9V10 you can get and all-access Passport Package for just $1,295, a savings of $400.00 off the standard price of $1,695."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I know I loved <A href="http://live.visitmix.com/">MIX in Vegas last month</A> and I'm jealous I don't get to go back in June. <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089504/">Put some money down on 22 for me!</A></P>
