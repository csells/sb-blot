<h1>Actipro's SyntaxEditor Adds Support for "Oslo"!</h1>
Do you like Intellipad so much that you want to host it? If so, than you need <A href="http://blog.actiprosoftware.com/post/2009/06/02/Integrating-MGrammar-DSL-parsers-with-SyntaxEditor-to-implement-syntax-highlighting.aspx">Actipro's SyntaxEditor</A>, which is not only a kick-butt syntax highlighting editor, but can be completely driven by an "Oslo" language definition in a .mg file. The demo is free and one of the samples is a fun little Intellipad clone. <A href="http://blog.actiprosoftware.com/post/2009/06/02/Integrating-MGrammar-DSL-parsers-with-SyntaxEditor-to-implement-syntax-highlighting.aspx">Check it out!</A>
