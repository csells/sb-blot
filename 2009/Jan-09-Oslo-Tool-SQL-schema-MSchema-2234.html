<h1>Oslo Tool: SQL schema -> MSchema</h1>
Kristofer Andersson is <A href="http://blog.huagati.com/res/index.php/about/">designing and implementing an airline reservation</A> in the open air. In the process, he ported his models to M, but not by writing them by hand, but by writing <A href="http://blog.huagati.com/res/index.php/2008/11/15/data-model-basics-part-11-the-huagatires-data-model-converted-to-m/">a tool to convert existing SQL schema to M</A>. Enjoy.
