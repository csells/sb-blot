<h1>Questionnaire DSL with Microsoft "Oslo"</h1>
Gerben van Loon, a lead developer at Avanade, has put together <A href="http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/gerben/archive/2009/10/30/questionnaire-dsl-with-microsoft-quot-oslo-quot-overview.aspx">a nice overview of a DSL they've been building for describing questionnaires in "M", seeing how they flow in Quadrant and then executing them on their web site</A>.
