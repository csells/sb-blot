<h1>From "Oslo" to SQL Server Modeling</h1>
<P>Extra! Extra! Read all about it!</P>
<P>Doug Purdy, my boss and one of the chiefs on the "Oslo" project has just announced <A href="http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2009/11/10/from-oslo-to-sql-server-modeling/">the move from codename "Oslo" to SQL Server Modeling</A>, which is the name we'll be using for starting now for the group of "M", "Quadrant" and Repository that you've come to know and love.</P>
<P>Tune in on November 17th, the first day of the PDC, for <A href="http://msdn.com/data">the new unified Data Developer Center</A>, which will include all manner of data technologies, including XML, DataReader, DataSet, LINQ to SQL, Data Services (aka "Astoria") and Entity Framework. One stop shopping!</P>
