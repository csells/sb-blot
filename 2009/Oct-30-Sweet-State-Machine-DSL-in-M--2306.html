<h1>Sweet State Machine DSL in "M"</h1>
<P><A href="http://new.efficientcoder.net/">Kevin D. Wolf</A> has built <A href="http://new.efficientcoder.net/2009/10/oslo-state-machine-editor-in.html">a sweet little language to describe state machines</A>:</P>
<P><EM>The States of a Invoice are New, Reviewed, Submitted, Paid, Overdue and Canceled.</EM></P>
<P><EM>An Invoice can transition from New to Reviewed and Canceled.<BR>An Invoice can transition from Reviewed to Submitted and Canceled.<BR>An Invoice can transition from Submitted to Paid, Overdue and Canceled.<BR>An Invoice can transition from Overdue to Paid and Canceled.</EM></P>
<P>He built this with a language definition in "M". What could be simpler?</P>
