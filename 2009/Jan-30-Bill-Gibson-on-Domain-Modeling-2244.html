<h1>Bill Gibson on Domain Modeling</h1>
<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/billgibson/">Bill Gibson</A> is an architect on the Oslo team and is in charge of our <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd129638.aspx">M coding conventions</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd326765.aspx">modeling patterns</A> documents. He's started blogging recently and has a nice post about <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/billgibson/archive/2009/01/27/domain-modeling.aspx">domain modeling in Oslo</A>. He's a good guy to hit up with questions about how to model various constructs in M or just modeling questions in general. He's been doing this modeling thing <EM>forever</EM>...</P>
