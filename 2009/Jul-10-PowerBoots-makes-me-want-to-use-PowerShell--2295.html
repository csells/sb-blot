<h1>PowerBoots makes me want to use PowerShell!</h1>

<P>I've picked up <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">PowerShell</A> half a dozen times or more. The central premise, that I can pipe streams of objects instead of streams of text between programs, is pure genius. However, in the day-to-day, two things make me put it down again every single time:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The differences between ps and cmd.exe are annoying and unnecessary.</LI>
<LI>The lack of pushing the boundaries on the text output in a GUI window leaves me wondering what I really gain when I get over the hump of #1.</LI></OL>
<P>I understand the need to "reboot" the DOS command line and get something scalable and consistent, but ps is a superset of cmd.exe and aliasing could've made the transition seamless. However, because little more than "dir" works (and "dir /s" doesn't) I'm constantly bumping into barriers just trying to get my work done in the new shell.</P>
<P>And I'd be really ready to learn ps, especially since it's everywhere now, but what am I really gaining? I never wrote a bunch of shell scripts in cmd.exe and I don't find myself writing them in ps either, which means that the cool "piping objects" thing doesn't make my life any simpler. What I really really want is for the text window of the ps shell to also be something active, e.g. if I do a "dir", I'd like to be able to click on a file or folder in output of dir and open it or right-click on a file and choose a method on the .NET File object to execute. Even better, I'd like all of that functionality but with a keyboard command interface like the old <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander">Norton Commander</A> used to provide. I've tried the ps IDEs and GUI shells and haven't liked any of them.</P>
<P>Anyway, the first thing that's made me really really want to move to ps is <A href="http://huddledmasses.org/powerboots/">PowerBoots</A>! It's starting to really deliver on what I had hoped to get out of ps and it feels like <A href="/2177">Shoes</A>, which I already know I love. <A href="http://huddledmasses.org/powerboots/">Check it out!</A></P>
