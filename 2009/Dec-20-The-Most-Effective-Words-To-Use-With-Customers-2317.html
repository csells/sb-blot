<h1>The Most Effective Words To Use With Customers</h1>
<P>Fred Gleeck had this to say about what not to say to customers and what to say instead:</P>
<P>There's a right way and a wrong way to talk to callers. Even about the simplest matters. And make no mistake: Talking the wrong way can turn a loyal customer into an annoyed ex-customer. I have a name for talking the right way: PosiTalk (tm).</P>
<P>PosiTalk is an attitude. It shows you're concerned. Professional. Helpful. And, while it sometimes requires a few extra words, it can make a big difference. below you'll find some common negative phrases, and the PosiTalk alternatives. Post them. Use them. And speak the language that keeps customers calling. After all... they pay the bills!</P>
<P>Negative: She/He is out to lunch...<BR>PosiTalk: She/He isn't available at the moment. May I take a message.</P>
<P>Negative: I can't do that...<BR>PosiTalk: Here's what we can do.</P>
<P>Negative: Hold on a minute...<BR>PosiTalk: Could you hold a moment, please?</P>
<P>Negative: That's company policy...<BR>PosiTalk: The way we'd normally handle that is...</P>
<P>Negative: I don't know...<BR>PosiTalk: I don't have the answer to that. If you'll hold a moment, I'd be happy to find out.</P>
<P>Negative: Huh? (or: What?)<BR>PosiTalk: Pardon me?</P>
<P>Negative: He/She is no longer with us...<BR>PosiTalk: He/She has accepted another position, but his/her calls are now being taken by...</P>
<P>Negative: She/He is busy bow...<BR>PosiTalk: She/He's not available at the moment. How can I help you?</P>
