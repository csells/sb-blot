<h1>"M" For Language Definition in November 2009 CTP</h1>
<p align="left">
In <a href="http://msdn.com/data/">the November 2009 CTP of &quot;Oslo&quot;</a>, we've 
got some new DSL features in &quot;M&quot;, three of which I couldn't wait for the PDC to 
brag about.</p>

<p align="left">
Notice the following in this screenshot of Intellipad:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The use of <strong>an expression on the right-hand side</strong> 
	to calculate the full name from the first and last name from the parsed 
	input: Name =&gt; f + &quot; &quot; + l (&quot;M&quot; supports a rich expression syntax for a 
	variety of data types).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The use of ToInteger32 to provide <strong>output data 
	conversion</strong> of the Age token as different from the default of string 
	(there's one of these functions for each of the supported &quot;M&quot; data types).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">The orange highlighted text in the left-hand pane shows a 
	breakpoint and notice that Intellipad knows that &quot;yours old.&quot; is a single 
	thing, so highlights the entire phrase. Also notice the &quot;notification&quot; pane 
	on the far right to show what the data is that's being parsed right now. 
	This indicates that Intellipad is now in <strong>DSL debugging mode</strong> 
	and lets you step through your input data and debug your language.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You'll also notice richer error information in the Error List at 
the bottom of the Intellipad window, but that I could've waited to tell you 
about. : )</p>
<p align="left">All of these &quot;M&quot; features and more can be yours for the low low 
price of absolutely nothing in <a href="http://msdn.com/data/">the latest CTP of 
&quot;Oslo&quot;</a>, which you can download on November 17th, the first day of
<a href="http://microsoftpdc.com">the PDC</a>. </p>
