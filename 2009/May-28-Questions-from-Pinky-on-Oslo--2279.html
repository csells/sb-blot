<h1>Questions from Pinky on "Oslo"</h1>
<P>Jeff Pinkston, the lead program manager on the "M" languages team has some questions that he'd love your feedback on:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="http://tinyfinger.blogspot.com/2009/05/m-interop-with-xml-and-others.html">How do you think about "M" inter-operating with XML? XSD? Other data formats?</A></LI>
<LI><A href="http://tinyfinger.blogspot.com/2009/05/whats-purpose-of-types.html">Given that OO languages are nominally typed and "M" is structurally typed, what is the purpose of a type? How do you think about it?</A></LI></UL>
<P>The "Oslo" team is just at the beginning of our last real milestone before the PDC in November, so the answers to these questions help us to decide how to spend our time. I know that it seems like Microsoft has the ability to <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">crank out the great works of Shakespeare</A>, but we're limited by time and resources, too, so if you have an opinion on these questions, <A href="http://tinyfinger.blogspot.com/">drop by Pinky's place</A> and let him know what you think. Or, if you've got other <A href="https://connect.microsoft.com/oslo">suggestions about how to improve "Oslo", drop them into our suggestion box</A>!</P>
