<h1>Rocky's MCsla on the Olso May CTP</h1>
<A href="http://www.lhotka.net/">Rockford Lhotka</A> of <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Rockford%20Lhotka">several C# and VB books</A> and the world-renown <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/cslanet/">CSLA .NET business object framework</A> has ported his <A href="http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/MCslaOnTheOlsoMayCTP.aspx">"Oslo"-based MCsla.NET</A> to the May 2009 CTP. For the part that he's made work in "Oslo," Rocky has told me that the amount of code you need to write to take advantage of his framework is down by 90% over the C#/VB.NET versions, which sounds like a pretty big win to me. Enjoy!
