<h1>Data and Modeling Talks from PDC 2009</h1>
<P>If you weren't lucky enough to be able to attend this year's PDC, not only did you not get a killer laptop, but you didn't get to see the Data &amp; Modeling talks live and in person. Fortunately, Doug has a nice list of them so you can <A href="http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2009/11/22/pdc-2009-data-and-modeling-talks-2/">watch them from the comfort of your own home</A>. Enjoy!</P>
