<h1>Do you know someone that needs dinner this Thanksgiving?</h1>
<P><IMG align=right src="http://www.shoppingblog.com/pics/turkeydinneromahasteaks.jpg"> The boys and I were driving past a church with a holiday bizarre, so we stopped by. It was a mix of silent auction, bake sale and a $1 raffle for a turkey dinner with all the fixings. I made several comments about how they could skip the formality of the drawing and to make sure they could read my phone number on the back of my raffle ticket, because I was obviously going to win. They laughed.</P>
<P>When they called this morning to let me know that I had won, they told me that they remembered me and I laughed.</P>
<P>Anyway, the Sells Brothers and I have already picked up all we need for our Thanksgiving dinner, so if you know of a family in the Portland metro area without the means for a traditional dinner this holiday season, please let me know. I doubt it'll be so big that I'll need a sled to cart it through the streets, but I'm happy to deliver it when it needs to go. You can leave a comment on this post or <A href="mailto:csells@sellsbrothers.com?subject=I know of someone that needs a turkey this Thanksgiving">drop me a line</A>.</P>
<P>Happy holidays, everyone.</P>
