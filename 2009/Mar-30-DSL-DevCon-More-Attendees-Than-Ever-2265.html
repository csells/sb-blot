<h1>DSL DevCon: More Attendees Than Ever</h1>
<P>This year's <a href="/conference">DevCon for DSLs</A> has 25% more attendees than any other previous DevCon. In this economy, I'm amazed by this.</P>
<P>And it's not just people from the US or even the Pacific Northwest. Not only do we have people from all over the country, but folks are coming from Canada, the UK, Scotland, France, South America and one attendee, Tomas Petricek, a student at Charles University, is coming from the Czech Republic.</P>
<P>Luckily, as we slide into home, there are still a scant few seats left if you'd like to <a href="/public/conference/#Sign_Up!">register, but be quick before they're all gone</A>!</P>
<P>I so miss this conference. Why don't I do this more often?!</P>
