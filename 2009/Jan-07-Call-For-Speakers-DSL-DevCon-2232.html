<h1>Call For Speakers: DSL DevCon</h1>
<P>Are you interested in presenting a 45-minute talk on some Domain Specific Language (DSL) related topic? It doesn't matter which platform or OS you're targeting. It also doesn't matter whether you're an author, a vendor, a professional speaker or a developer in the trenches (in fact, I tend to be biased toward the latter). We're after interesting and unique applications of DSL technology and if you're doing good work in that area, then I need you to <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=DSL DevCon Abstract Submission">send me a session topic and 2-4 sentence abstract along with a little bit about yourself</A>.</P>
<P>I'll be taking submissions 'til February 9th, 2009, but <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=DSL DevCon Abstract Submission">don't delay</A>. Passion and a burning story to tell count twice as much as anything else.</P>
<P>And don't be shy about spreading this announcement around! I've got good coverage in the .NET and Windows communities, but don't know very many folks in the Java or Unix or hardcore modeling worlds, so if you're in that world, let those guys know! Thanks.</P>
<P>The <a href="/public/conference/">DSL DevCon</a> itself will be in Redmond, WA on the Microsoft campus April 16-17, 2009, right after <A href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/">the Lang.NET conference</A>. Lang.NET will be focused on general-purpose languages, whereas the DSL DevCon will focus on&nbsp;domain-specific languages.&nbsp;The idea is that if you want to attend one or the other or both, that's totally fine. We'll have 2.5 days of Lang.NET on April 14-16 and then 1.5 days of DSL DevCon content.</P>
<P>Oh, and the cost for both conferences is the same: $0.</P>
<P>We're only accepting 150 attendees to either conference. Every one of the five previous DevCons have sold out, so when we open registration, you'll want to be quick about getting your name on the list. </P>
<P><A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=DSL DevCon Abstract Submission">Submit your DSL-related talk idea!</A></P>
