<h1>Why I Hate My iPhone</h1>
<IMG src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/149/353633542_4f0a6d52fd_o.png" align=right> 
<P>I've had an iphone for the last coupla weeks and there are some things that drive me crazy about it!</P>
<UL>
<LI>The battery life is crazy short. I can't make it more than 6 hours on a charge. Good lord!</LI>
<LI>Pandora, an app I dearly love, can't run in the background like the ipod app, so I can't do SMS, email, check my calendar, etc. while I'm listening. Are you kidding me?</LI>
<LI>There's no tactile feedback on the keyboard, although the auto-correct is amazing ("let go, let iphone!").</LI>
<LI>There's no copy-paste. I've never used a smart phone that did, but I soooo want this feature!</LI>
<LI>There's no free out-of-the-box app for using my iphone as a laptop modem, which is something I really loved about my T-Mobile Dash.</LI>
<LI>I used to be able to use my T-Mobile account to get free wifi at Starbucks. Can I do the same with my AT&amp;T account? I have the unlimited data option.</LI>
<LI>There's no turn-by-turn directions on the map app and easy re-routing when I go off route. It's so close; let's go all the way!</LI></UL>
<P>And all of that pales in comparison to the single worst deficiency in the app-suite of the iphone for which I've found no good work-arounds; the calendar app is nearly worthless in a business environment:</P>
<UL>
<LI>There is no snooze, so I can't set an alert for 15 minutes and then 5 minutes before, then at the time, etc. In a meeting driven environment like Microsoft, the lack of snooze means that I'm actually missing meetings.</LI>
<LI>There is no way to invite other people to events. Further, if I create an event via Exchange so I can invite someone, I can't edit it on the iPhone.</LI>
<LI>I can't do a Reply All to an event to ask a question or let folks know I'm running a little late.</LI>
<LI>There is no detection of phone numbers or addresses in event locations or the body, which means I get no integration with the phone or map apps. This means that I'm memorizing phone numbers and addresses stored in events so I can enter them manually. I have a smart phone so I don't have to remember this stuff!</LI>
<LI>My appointments don't show on the home screen, so I have to constantly check the calendar app to see what my day is going to look like.</LI></UL>
<P>The calendar app is the single thing that makes me miss my Dash. Someone please tell me there's a workaround to these issues! I'll pay!</P>
<P>The reason I list the things I hate about my iphone is because the list of things I love about it would be impossible to enumerate. I had a T-Mobile Dash for years and it went with me everywhere. It was as big a boost in my electronic lifestyle as my first laptop. After having a smart phone for contacts, email, music and surfing the web, I couldn't go back. Plus, I loved the Dash so much that I'd try a new phone every 6 months or so and then bring it back because it just didn't compare.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the iPhone replaced my Dash in 24 hours. I've been twittering iPhone development related apps. I've purchased&nbsp;iphone charing cables for everywhere in my life where I sit for more than 5 minutes. I want&nbsp;to integrate my iphone as closely into my car as possible.</P>
<P>They will pry my iphone out of my cold dead hands.</P>
