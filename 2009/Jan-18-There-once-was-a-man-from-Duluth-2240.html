<h1>There once was a man from Duluth</h1>
<P>nearly 40 years old; past his youth!<BR>But tonight with a smile,<BR>he swam non-stop for a mile.<BR>First time in his life - that's the truth!</P>
<P>I&nbsp;swam a mile when&nbsp;I was 17 and again last summer, but never non-stop before.&nbsp;I know it doesn't compare to real swimmers (it took me 45 minutes), but I've been swimming for less than a year. Plus i found two meaningful rhymes for "Duluth."&nbsp;I rock. : )</P>
