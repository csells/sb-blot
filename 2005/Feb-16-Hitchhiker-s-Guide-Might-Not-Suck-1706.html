<h1>Hitchhiker's Guide Might Not Suck</h1>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/103-8833209-8659037">Here</a>. After watching <A href="http://www.amazon.com/">the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trailer on Amazon.com</A>, I have to say, it might not suck. Any Portland Nerds that want to join me for the first show on 4/29 (but don't tell my boss, he thinks I'm working that day... : )?
