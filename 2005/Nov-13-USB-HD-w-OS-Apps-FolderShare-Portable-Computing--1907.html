<h1>USB HD w/ OS/Apps + FolderShare = Portable Computing?</h1>
<P>If you could boot Windows Vista from a USB drive large enough for the OS and apps, like <A href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/hardware/05/11/13/1635229.shtml?tid=90&amp;tid=137">this version of Linux</A>, and log into <A href="https://www.foldershare.com">FolderShare</A> for your data, you could use any computer that allowing booting from USB into a temporary terminal (although device drivers would be a challenge).</P>
