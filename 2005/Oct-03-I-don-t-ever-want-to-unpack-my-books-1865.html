<h1>I don't ever want to unpack my books</h1>
<P>I don't ever want to unpack <A href="/12506">my books</A>. Instead, I want a paperback-sized tablet PC whose sole job is to run eReader loaded with all of my books. It's work like <A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</A>, <A href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/business/03yahoo.html">the Open Content Alliance</A> and <A href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safari</A> that may finally make this happen.</P>
<P>However, like my DVD and music collection, I am willing to purchase my book collection one more time in digital form, but only if it is non-DRM'd so that I can use the book where ever I want to. It's no good to be to be able to read my book at my PC, but not in bed or in line at the airport.</P>
