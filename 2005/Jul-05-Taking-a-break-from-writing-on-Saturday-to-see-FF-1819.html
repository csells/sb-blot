<h1>Taking a break from writing on Saturday to see FF</h1>
<P>Rich is tired of me blowing off the local nerd events, so he set up something he knows I can't stay away from: <A href="http://nerddinner.com/blogs/portland/archive/2005/07/05/3855.aspx">an afternoon showing of Fantastic Four</A>. I'm an FF fan from way back (every time Don signs his emails " 'nuf said " I get a little tingle of nostalgia). I'm been loving the Ultimate Fantastic Four trade paperbacks (that's what adults call comic books that have been collected into a bigger, more expensive book).</P>
<P>I don't have much hope that this movie will be any good, but the Brothers Sells and I can't not go. Feel free to join us! Rich has picked <A href="http://nerddinner.com/blogs/portland/archive/2005/07/05/3855.aspx">the 12:25pm showing on Saturday, July 9th, at the new Century 16 Cedar Hill Crossing theater</A> that I love, just to make sure there would be no way I could say "no." Plus, I'll be deep in the throes of finalizing the Avalon book chapters that day (along with every other day this week -- what a way to burn vacation days), so any excuse to avoid the writing will be good. Come one, come all!</P>
