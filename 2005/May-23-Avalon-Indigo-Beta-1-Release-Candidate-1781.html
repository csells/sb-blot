<h1>Avalon + Indigo Beta 1 Release Candidate</h1>
<P>Today Microsoft has published <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B789BC8D-4F25-4823-B6AA-C5EDF432D0C1">the release candidate of Avalon and Indigo Beta 1</A>. The most interesting features of this release over the CTP releases of the past is that these bits work on Visual Studio 2005 beta 2, both full and express. Enjoy!</P>
