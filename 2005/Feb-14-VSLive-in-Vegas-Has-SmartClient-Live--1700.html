<h1>VSLive in Vegas Has "SmartClient Live"</h1>
<P>The <A href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/vslive/2005/lv/">Las Vegas edition of VSLive</A> (May 8-11, 2005) will include smart client coverage: "SmartClient Live! - Pragmatic and practical advice on smart client development with VB, C#, and .NET Framework." There's no real description of what that really means, but it's got potential. : )</P>
