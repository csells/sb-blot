<h1>New Workspace Link for RegexDesigner</h1>
<a href="/12425">Here</a>. <P>The nice folks at GotDotNet have decided in their infinite wisdom to move all of the workspaces to a new hierarchy w/o forwarding the URLs and then leaving a message behind indicating that such a thing is temporary to keep users on their toes:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"<STRONG>Operational Troubleshooting in Progress</STRONG><BR>The Gotdotnet team is aware of the current site operational issues and is working on a solution. Thanks for your patience."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Anyway, due to popular demand, I've updated <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=01e0dfb7-0182-45cd-94f7-2ed2df2504a9">the GotDotNet workspaces link to the RegexDesigner</A> and other tools. Enjoy.</P>
