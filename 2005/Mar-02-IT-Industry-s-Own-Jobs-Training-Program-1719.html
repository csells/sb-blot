<h1>IT Industry's Own Jobs Training Program</h1>
<P>My brother graduated from college with a BS in EE in 2000 and was, predictably, unable to find a job competing with certified, experienced&nbsp;engineers willing to work for the same money after the bubble burst. He was fortunate enough to be able to move into his Mom's basement and get an interest-free loan for an MS in EE that lead to a wonderful job, but if you're not so lucky (hey! I've got next dibs on my Mom's basement!), then check out <A href="http://www.techengage.org/">TechEngage</A>:</P>
