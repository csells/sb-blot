<p>On the left, you see Lt. Uhura with her wireless Bluetooth headset (although 
I'm not sure of the made and model). On the right, you see me with mine (<a href="http://www.bluespoons.com/products.htm">the 
Nextlink Bluespoon AX</a>). I've waited all my life to be as cool as the folks 
on Star Trek and now it's finally happened! I'm ready for my replicator, 
transporter, tricorder and Holodeck now...</p>
