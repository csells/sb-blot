<h1>When the student is ready, the teacher will come</h1>
<P>I've been digging into .NET application extensibility lately, discovering the various pieces discussed <A href="/1708">here</A>. And then, just when I'd despaired of finding a resource that covered the issues in depth, a copy of "<A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619883/chrissells/">Customizing the Microsoft .NET Framework Common Language Runtime</A>," by Steven Pratscher, showed up at my door (that happens sometimes, but I've never quite figured out how...).</P>
<P>Steven's a PM on the CLR team and his book has wonderful chapter titles like:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Loading Assemblies in Extensible Applications</LI>
<LI>Extending the CLR Security System to Protect Your Extensible Application</LI>
<LI>Enforcing Application-Specific Programming Model Constraints</LI></UL>
<P>And if you're thinking, "Big deal, .NET 2.0 is coming out soon and will makes this info obsolete," au contraire, mon frere! This book is based on the .NET 2.0 beta, so the concepts (and hopefully most of the details) are&nbsp;the latest and greatest (and you can download the source that goes along with the book <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/books/products/6895/">here</A>). I plan on having quite a bit of fun with this book! Thank you book-mailing-to-my-house-god, wherever you are...</P>
