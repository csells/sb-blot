<h1>Now *that's* how you want a Virtual PC to be!</h1>
<P>I was using one of my computers this morning, surfing around, reading my email, getting started with the day, etc. After a bit of fooling about, I went looking for the work I wanted to continue from yesterday. I couldn't find it. Then I went looking for the program I was using to work on the file. I couldn't find it.</P>
<P>Just before I was about to reinstall things, I realized -- I was running a VPC image, not the computer's native image. I couldn't freakin' tell the difference! Nice...</P>
