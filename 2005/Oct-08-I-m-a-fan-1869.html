<h1>I'm a fan</h1>
<P>Charles Petzold taught the first generation of real Windows programmers.</P>
<P>Charles Petzold sold so many copies of Programming Windows 3.1 that he broke the MSPress accounting software.</P>
<P>Charles Petzold helped define what it means to write books for Windows programmers.</P>
<P>I'm a Charles Petzold fan. I'm also a fan of the other luminaries of this community, including Jeff Prosise, Jeff Richter, Matt Pietrek, John Robbins and Don Box.</P>
<P>They're the giants that provide the provided the shoulders.</P>
<P>P.S. Petzold has literally sold more copies of Programming Windows 3.1 in a <i>single quarter</i> of the 16-bit years than I've sold of my books in a 10-year writing career.</P>
