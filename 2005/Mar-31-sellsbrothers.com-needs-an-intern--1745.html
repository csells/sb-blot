<h1>sellsbrothers.com needs an intern!</h1>
<P>I am completely swamped this year and sellsbrothers.com needs a serious upgrade, so, I'm looking for one or more interns interested in the following work:</P>
<UL>
<LI>rebuilding sellsbrothers.com from scratch in ASP.NET 2.0 and either <A href="http://www.telligentsystems.com/Solutions/OpenSource.aspx">Community Server</A> or <A href="http://www.dasblog.net/documentation/CategoryView.aspx?category=Overview">dasBlog</A></LI>
<LI>real-world requirements like porting the existing content and keeping existing links working, even embedded &lt;a name&gt; links</LI>
<LI>real-world working conditions (like this is the entire spec of the site reimplementation)</LI>
<LI>working with a graphics artist to implement a new site design (I like <A href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Ed's site</A>)</LI>
<LI>experimenting with ways to close the gap on RSS comments based on work already done with <a href="/12548">the wfw:commentRss standard</A></LI>
<LI>hands-on mentoring from an experienced member of the Windows developer community (aka I promise to complain loud and long if you build stuff I don't like... : )</LI>
<LI>exposing the complete content of the site for consumption by other web sites and smart clients</LI>
<LI><A href="/1735">hosting MSDN content</A> in the site's chrome</LI>
<LI>no money, but you do get to brag about reimplementing one of the web's most popular one-person developer-centric sites, serving almost 1M unique visitors/month</LI>
<LI>integrating existing features, like the Windows Forms FAQ and the Wahoo! check for the .NET Framework</LI>
<LI>free access to the new site for life for you and your ancestors (and let me throw in 256 free GUIDs while I'm at it... : )</LI>
<LI>integrating ads into the overall design</LI>
<LI>btw, did I mention there's no money?</LI></UL>
<P>If you're interested, <A href="mailto:csells@sellsbrothers.com?subject=I want to work for no money!">drop me a line</A>&nbsp;(I'm sure I'll be flooded... : ).</P>
