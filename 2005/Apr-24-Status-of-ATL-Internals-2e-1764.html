<h1>Status of ATL Internals 2e</h1>
<P>More people than you'd expect have been asking, so here's an update on ATL Internals 2e.</P>
<P>This effort actually started in 2003, when Kirk Fertita updated the first 9 chapters to ATL7 as provided in VS 2002. Then he had to go work on his start-up, which represented his only income stream and would've gone belly up w/o him&nbsp;(selfish bastard! : ).</P>
<P>Then George Shepherd did a little work, writing bits of two new chapters on ATL Server before he had to bale.</P>
<P>Now, finally, we have an author that's going to see this book to the finish line: Chris Tavares. I've written with him before and he's excellent. He's already ported chapters 1-4 to ATL8 as provided in VS 2005 and is on schedule to bring my and Brent's work on ATL3, Kirk and George's work on ATL7 and his own new work into a cohesive ATL8 book to hit the shelves 3-4 months after VS05 has hit RTM.</P>
