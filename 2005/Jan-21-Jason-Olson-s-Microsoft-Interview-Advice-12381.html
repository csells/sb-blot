<h1>Jason Olson's Microsoft Interview Advice</h1>

<p>Jason Olson recently interviewed for an SDE/T position (Software Development 
Engineer in Test) at Microsoft and although he didn't get it, he provides the 
following words of advice for folks about to interview for the first time:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Just Do It</li>
	<li>Remember, no matter how much you might know your interviewer, it is 
	important to not forget that it is still in interview</li>
	<li>Pseudocode! Pseudocode! Pseudocode!</li>
	<li>But, as long as you verbalize what you're thinking you should be in 
	pretty good shape</li>
	<li>Bring an energy bar or something to snack on between breaks in order to 
	keep your energy level up</li>
	<li>[B]ring a bottle&nbsp;of water and keep it filled up</li>
	<li>A lunch interview is still an interview!</li>
	<li>Know the position you're interviewing for <i>[ed: unless you're 
	interviewing for an editing position, in which case you should know the 
	position for which you're interviewing]</i></li>
	<li>Your interview day is not only your opportunity to be interviewed, but 
	also your opportunity to interview the team/company</li>
</ul>
