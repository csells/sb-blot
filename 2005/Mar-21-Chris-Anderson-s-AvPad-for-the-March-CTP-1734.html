<h1>Chris Anderson's AvPad for the March CTP</h1>
Chris Anderson has updated XamlPad for the March 2005 CTP of Avalon and renamed it <A href="http://blog.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/e0b2f9bc-5a8f-4d5f-b378-16ca634e0646">AvPad</A>. As a tool for learning and experimenting with XAML/Avalon, it can't be beat. Enjoy!
