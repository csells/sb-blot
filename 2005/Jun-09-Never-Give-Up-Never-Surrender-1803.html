<h1>Never Give Up, Never Surrender</h1>
<P>I was reminiscing today that I've been turned away from most decent places in my career:</P>
<UL>
<LI>I went to a stupid high school that raised my grades a full letter when I moved there from a decent school system, leaving me ill-prepared for college</LI>
<LI>I was turned away from MIT, CalTech and Stanford out of high school, settling for the U of MN instead</LI>
<LI>I didn't even qualify for a phone screen from either Apple or Microsoft during or after college</LI>
<LI>I flunked most of my on-campus interviews and instead settled for a full-time position at the start-up where I'd worked during college (I was originally been hired there because it was run by alumni of my fraternity and I worked for beer money)</LI></UL>
<P>And yet, I got all I could out of every opportunity, performed all of the jobs I did manage to get with gusto, learned as much as possible and moved on to learn new things when it was time. Eventually, I found my "way" and I think I did all right, but only because I didn't let the door slams stop me. You shouldn't either.</P>
