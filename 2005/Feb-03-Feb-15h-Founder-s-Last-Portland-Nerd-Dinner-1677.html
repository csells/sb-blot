<h1>Feb 15h, Founder's Last Portland Nerd Dinner</h1>
<a href="http://snowstormlife.com/blogs/bliz/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c7d67e44-9c36-4a49-9be9-96fff7ec29bd">Here</a>. <P>Come and see Jim Blizzard off right. As the founder of the Portland Nerd Dinner, he will be sorely missed. If you want <A href="mailto:donations@theclaussens.com">to contribute to the planning of our founder's last dinner, drop Rich a line</A>. We've got some fun stuff planned, but could always use more. : )</P>
