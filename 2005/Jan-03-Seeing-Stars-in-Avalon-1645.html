<h1>Seeing Stars in Avalon</h1>
Savas Parastatidis has posted his early work <A href="http://savas.parastatidis.name/2004/12/21/86cbd8a6-e58d-4a3a-8b14-964fc44ed7c2.aspx">using Avalon 3D to visualize stars in the galaxy</A>. I don't believe that I've ever seen the stars line up like that, but the screen shots are cool anyway. : )
