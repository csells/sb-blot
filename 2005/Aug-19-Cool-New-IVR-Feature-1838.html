<h1>Cool New IVR Feature</h1>
<P>In a (very) past life, I used to write intergrated voice response (IVR) systems aka "voicemail hell." It may not seem like it, but we spent a *ton* of time trying to make a voice output/12-key&nbsp;input UI as friendly as possible.</P>
<P>However, I never thought of the IVR feature I ran into today. While transfering my utilities to our new address, one of the utilities put me on hold and offered to call me back when it was my turn in line (promising me that I would not lose my place). I've got <A href="http://www.audiovox.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=10001&amp;productId=13758&amp;langId=-1">the world's most perfect cell phone</A> and <A href="http://www.motorola.com/mdirect/demos/bluetooth03/">the world's most perfect Bluetooth headset</A>, so staying on hold was just as easy as not, but still, that's a damn cool feature.</P>
