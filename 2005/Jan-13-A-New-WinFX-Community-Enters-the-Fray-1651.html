<h1>A New WinFX Community Enters the Fray</h1>
<A class=headermaintitle id=Header1_HeaderTitle href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/deepakkapoor/">Deepak Kapoor</A>&nbsp;has launched a new WinFX community: <A href="http://www.deepwinfx.com">deepwinfx.com</A>. It's pretty bare right now, but hopefully it'll flesh out nicely. I'll be keeping an eye on it. Good luck, Deepak!
