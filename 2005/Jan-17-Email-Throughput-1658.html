<h1>Email Throughput</h1>
<P>To get technical work done, I sometimes let my inbox fill up beyond what makes my comfortable. Today, that caught up with me, but I plowed into it and handled it like a man:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Handled 206 incoming emails (filed, deleted or dealt with in some other way):</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Started with 47 emails in my inbox</LI>
<LI>Received 177 emails</LI>
<LI>Ended with 18 emails in my inbox</LI></UL>
<LI>Sent 92 outgoing emails</LI></UL>
<P>I don't normally track such things, so I can't say if that's a lot or a little, but it sure <EM>seemed</EM> like a lot to me. <EM>&lt;whew&gt;</EM></P>
