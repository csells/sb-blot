<h1>Windows Forms Programming 2005 in C# Submitted!</h1>
<P>I packaged off the final chapters, figures and PDF files for submission of the WinForms 2.0 book this morning. Michael made it easy by fixing all the last minute nits I found, producing the PDFs and bundling all of the figure files together (he separated the graphics from the Word docs using a WinForms 2.0 program, of course!).</P>
<P>In spite of the fact that I've been working on long-lead prototype coding for the last month and Mike's been moving to the US from Australia, we managed to get the book submitted a full 15.5 hours early (they meant midnight when they gave us a 12/16 deadline, didn't they?!?).</P>
<P>I'm so excited to get the book in your hands, that I've asked Mike to check in the files he's got checked out so that we can post the code samples ASAP. It'll still be a while before the book is in your hands, though. We took 22 months to write it, but it's the 3 months it takes to print it that always sticks in my craw the most for some reason. : )</P>
<P>Wahoo (2)!</P>
