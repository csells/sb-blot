<h1>Grid: The King of Avalon Layout</h1>
The Grid is by far the most useful, powerful and general purpose layout tool in Avalon. As a demonstration of that, Amir Khella, a Microsoft PM on an Avalon-related team, plays with the Grid to build a fish eye effect, <A href="http://www.elementsofpassion.com/archives/2005/07/playing_around.html">duplicating the behavior of the scaling OSX toolbar with 8 lines of C# code</A>.&nbsp;He then goes on to implement the trick in 2D to <A href="http://www.elementsofpassion.com/archives/2005/07/more_avalon_gri.html">scale images as you mouse around</A>. Cool stuff.
