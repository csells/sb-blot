<h1>Telling us we're Bad and Ugly is Good!</h1>
<P>Rod Paddock sat down to use Avalon in a real way and then kept <A href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/rod/archive/2005/01/19/3906.aspx">notes</A>.</P>
<P>Some of those notes said good things about Avalon</P>
<P>Some of them said not so good things.</P>
<P>While we appreciate the good things, we <EM>need</EM> to hear about the bad things. And <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/archive/2005/01/19/12155.aspx">we appreciate it</A>. Thanks, Rod!</P>
<P>Keep it coming!</P>
