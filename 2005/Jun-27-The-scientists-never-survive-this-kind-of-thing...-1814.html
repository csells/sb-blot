<h1>The scientists never survive this kind of thing...</h1>
<P>I can't believe nobody* blogged about <A href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15739502-13762,00.html">this</A> today! Isn't <A href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15739502-13762,00.html">this</A> the beginning of most sci-fi horror movies?!? By the end of the movie, all of the scientists die and only one good-looking&nbsp;male/female pair&nbsp;are left, having barely averted the Apocalypse (no one every expects the Apocalypse...). Since I identify with the scientists and barely know anyone good looking enough to survive, I'm not so sure <A href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,15739502-13762,00.html">reincarnating dogs into zombies</A> is such a good idea...</P>
<P>*by "nobody" I mean "nobody" I read, of course -- I sure it was all the news amongst the "dear diary" set : )</P>
