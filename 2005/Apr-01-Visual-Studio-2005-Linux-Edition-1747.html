<h1>Visual Studio 2005 Linux Edition</h1>
<P><EM>"I first heard about it at a Seattle area Starbucks. I mean, I was just like sitting there drinking my Venti no-whip triple shot soy latte and I looked over at this dude sitting next to me who was working on a laptop and I saw something on his screen. So I said "Dude is that the new version of Eclipse?" and he said "No, it's <A href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=33023">Visual Studio 2005 Linux Edition</A>". Then he typed a few lines of code and created an Indigo service that runs on the Apache web server. I was like "Dude!" and almost spilled my latte."<BR></EM><EM>--Anonymous Seattle Youth</EM></P>

However, we will no longer continue to build on that technology preferring instead to <A href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=33023">move developers to .NET</A>."<BR></EM><EM>--Anonymous Sun Representative</EM></P>
