<h1>I Love Arguing with Ian</h1>
<a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Here</a>. <P>Ian and I submitted the final manuscript for <A href="http://www.bookpool.com/sm/0596101139">Programming Avalon, Beta Edition</A>, on July 13th (right on time, I'll point out). Since then, the O'Reilly folks have been working overtime to fix my prose (I'm not a big fan of editorial guidelines or templates). As part of that process, they sent Ian and me a 400+ page PDF file for us to check. In the process, I submit changes to the manuscript, Ian argues about the ones with which he disagrees and then I argue with his arguments. It's great fun.</P>
<P>Here an excerpt in which we're arguing over a single word that has nothing whatsoever to do with the technical content of the book while two professional editors from ORA watch, waiting for us to decide:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Page 51:&nbsp; You want to change "breathing space" to "breathing room"? &nbsp;Why?&nbsp; The term "breathing space" is a common idiom. &nbsp;(And judging by Google, that&#8217;s not just a UKism.) &nbsp;I prefer it to "breathing room", so unless there&#8217;s a good reason to change I'd prefer to leave it.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">[<SPAN class=GramE>csells</SPAN>] <SPAN class=SpellE>googlefight</SPAN> shows "breathing room" to be slightly more popular than "breathing space," plus I&#8217;d never personally heard the latter. Also, you use the word "space" in a close previous sentence and I liked the variety.</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><o:p>Here we're arguing over a single word again and, to help make my argument, I claim super powers:</o:p></SPAN></FONT></P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><o:p>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Page 205: Why do you want to change "useful" to "handy"? Is there something wrong with "useful"?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">[<SPAN class=GramE>csells</SPAN>] because you use the word "used" later in that same sentence. Having "useful" and "used" so close together made my spider sense tingle.</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Here we're dealing with the vagaries of our personal styles and my preference for brevity (Ian can highlight a single word and write several paragraphs on it, while I like to highlight several paragraphs and comment "huh?"). In this case, I circled an URL and said "too big:"</SPAN></FONT></P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Page 222: Yes it's a big URL, but there's not a lot I can do about that &#8211; if you can convince Microsoft to make a smaller URL in the next day or so, please do. &nbsp;There's a shrinkster URL in there too, so I don't see what the problem is. &nbsp;And I'm not going to agree to <SPAN class=GramE>removing</SPAN> the original URL.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">[<SPAN class=GramE>csells</SPAN>] I didn't say it was a *<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">long</SPAN></B>* URL (I can hardly blame you for that, Ian : ); I said it was a *<B><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">big</SPAN></B>* URL. What I meant was<SPAN class=GramE>,</SPAN> the font looks too big in comparison to the size of the fonts around it.</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Here we're arguing over grammatic style, again, while two professional editors look on, letting us fight it out like children in the backseat of the car on a family vacation:</SPAN></FONT></P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Page 224: I'm not quite sure what you&#8217;re proposing as the new text here, although I do see the problem. &nbsp;How about:<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">"(It doesn&#8217;t matter where the UICulture element appears within this section.)"</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">[<SPAN class=GramE>csells</SPAN>] I'm suggesting that I prefer parenthetical comments to be part of the sentence, e.g. "Foo sucks (and by 'sucks,' I mean 'blows')." You tend to do it the other way and I find it jarring, e.g. "Foo sucks. (And by 'sucks,' I mean 'blows.')" Plus, there's the matter of consistency, i.e. I do it in the former way in my writing and you do it in the latter way in yours; we should pick one and stick with it (and to be clear &#8211; we should pick my way : ). Unfortunately, I packed my <SPAN class=SpellE>Strunk</SPAN> &amp; White, but I have every confidence that they got it right, too. : )</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">In this case, after reading several hundred pages of the book <EM>again</EM>, I was getting a little punchy, so I highlighted a Bezier curve, redrew it by a couple of pixels and suggested that after doing the math in my head, I feared a bug in Avalon's rendering of Beziers; could ORA check it with their Cray?</SPAN></FONT></P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">

<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Page 252: Well those were all drawn in Avalon using the exact positions chosen for the control points. &nbsp;Also, I've been using Bezier curves for about 15 years now, and they all look exactly as I'd expect them to look. &nbsp;I just cranked up Illustrator on the Mac.&nbsp; It seems to agree with Avalon&#8230;&nbsp; So does Acrylic.&nbsp; What maths <SPAN class=GramE>are</SPAN> you doing that indicates a different result?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">[<SPAN class=GramE>csells</SPAN>] I was just teasing. If my mention of the use of a Cray wasn&#8217;t enough, didn&#8217;t the bit about me doing the math "in my head" tip you off? I am delighted to know that you spent time double-checking things, however. : )</SPAN></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
