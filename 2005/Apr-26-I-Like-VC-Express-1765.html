<h1>I Like VC# Express</h1>
<P>I was paving a box this weekend with <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=85ab132b-f1aa-4422-b053-272d79863013">the March Avalon/Indigo CTP</A> and I needed the matching <A href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/vs2005/downloads/ctp/">Feb CTP of VS05</A>, so I installed <A href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/5/e/a5efa6aa-b73c-4fa7-89b7-4a5fcd60f2a8/vcssetup.exe">the Feb CTP of VC# Express</A>. I have to say, I'm impressed. Avalon integrated w/ no trouble. I have all the Intellisense, key bindings, options, code formatting and generics support that I went looking for (although I did have to find the Show all settings option in the Options dialog).</P>
<P>Only two things bug me about Express. The first is minor: I'm used to starting VS with Start-&gt;Run: devenv [Enter] and now I have to start VC# Express with Start-&gt;Run: vcexpress [Enter]. Given that I can install a bunch of Express products, it makes sense to me to need to learn a new EXE name for each of them (especially if I slip Asynch COM out of long-term storage... [dumping]... there, plenty of room!).</P>
<P>The second thing that bugs me is that I'm not allowed to specific a spot on my hard drive when I create a new project. As a guy with a background thread running Alt-&gt;F-&gt;S every time I typing idles, having everything in a well-known place is important to me. I'm a developer. Things crash!</P>
<P>Overall, though, I'm loving VC# Express. Recommended.</P>
