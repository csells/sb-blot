<h1>George Carlin's Incomplete List of Impolite Words</h1>
<P><EM><STRONG>DISCLAIMER: Obviously, </STRONG></EM><A href="http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Vines/1521/carlin_audio.html"><EM><STRONG>this</STRONG></EM></A><EM><STRONG> completely violates George Carlin's copyright, but I purchased </STRONG></EM><A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000206AF/"><EM><STRONG>the $80 CD box set</STRONG></EM></A><EM><STRONG> and it wasn't on there, so I feel like I'm owed. Also, the audio is in RealMedia (.rm) audio format, whose player may have been the world's most aggressive piece of mainstream software before spyware became a plague to rival locusts and frogs falling from the sky, but a quick batch processing pass with </STRONG></EM><A href="http://www.goldwave.com/"><EM><STRONG>GoldWave</STRONG></EM></A><EM><STRONG> on the one computer in my network with a RealMedia audio codec installed and I've got the MP3 version. <FONT color=#ff0000>Finally, </FONT></STRONG></EM><A href="http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Vines/1521/carlin_audio.html"><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>this</FONT></STRONG></EM></A><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000> is completely work unsafe and you shouldn't even think of looking at </FONT></STRONG></EM><A href="http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Vines/1521/carlin_audio.html"><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>this web page</FONT></STRONG></EM></A><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000> at work, let alone listening to the file in question.</FONT></STRONG></EM></P>
<P>I can't believe that after all these years, I still find <A href="http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/Vines/1521/carlin_audio.html">George Carlin's Incomplete List of Impolite Words</A> amusing. It makes&nbsp;<A href="http://www.robrob8.com/song_parody/dl_songs2/petnamesforgenatalia.mp3">Tom Green's Pet Names for Genitalia</A>&nbsp;seem like a poem you'd write on a mother's day card. For your grandmother. On a dialysis machine.</P>
