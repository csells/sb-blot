<h1>Turning off special features in DVDs and CDs?</h1>
Does anyone know if it's possible to turn off the special PC features of DVDs and CDs? I'd like to avoid <A href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+will+wipe+Sonys+rootkit/2100-1002_3-5949041.html?tag=nefd.top">Sony-sponsored virus enablers</A> on CDs and <A href="http://www.intervideo.com/jsp/Home.jsp">required players</A> for DVD content and just treat each of these CDs and DVDs as un-special. Is such a thing possible?
