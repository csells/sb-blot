<h1>i-mate SP3 Smartphone: How do I love thee?</h1>
<P>Let me count the ways:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pocket-sized and no bigger than my old dumb phone and tons smaller than tricorder-sized PDAs</LI>
<LI>Synchronized calendar, contacts and inbox every 10 minutes everywhere I go</LI>
<LI>IM and web browsing everywhere I go</LI>
<LI>512MB miniSD upgrade (for $60), giving me room enough for 300+ minutes of songs/audio books, making the phone a wonderful mp3 player, both for personal use (via the included stereo headphones) and in my car (via a $3 Radio Shack part, the Audio Adapter 274-373)</LI>
<LI>Bluetooth headset, freeing me from untaggling wires all the damn time and letting me answer the phone while it's still in my pocket</LI>
<LI>Voice tags, letting my dial the phone while it's still in my pocket</LI>
<LI>Extensible with inexpensive custom apps of all kinds, including ones I can build myself in <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=1DACDB3D-50D1-41B2-A107-FA75AE960856">native</A> or <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a6c4f799-ec5c-427c-807c-4c0f96765a81">managed</A> code (and <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nleghari/articles/smartphone.aspx">a wealth of development information</A>)</LI>
<LI>Backlit ebook for darkened movie theaters during the commercials and the slow bits</LI>
<LI>A quicky flashlight in a pinch</LI>
<LI>Theoretically acts as a modem for my PC to give it an internet connection via my cell phone's GPRS service, although I haven't gotten that set up yet : )</LI></OL>
<P>That's not to say that all is well. The following mars the i-mate's perfection:</P>
<OL>
<LI>When the keypad is locked and a notification pops up, the screen remains dark, but the Unlock button turns into the Dismiss button, which dismisses the notification w/o showing it first</LI>
<LI>Notifications can only be snoozed for 5 minutes</LI>
<LI>No WMP10 and WMP9 on the smartphone has terrible playlist management</LI>
<LI>A dearth of web sites targeted at the smart phone. I've only found msnbc.com so far. I really miss a decent movie showtime info web site (imdb.com works, but it's a pain)</LI>
<LI>Cramped screen and keyboard (I've heard the Motorola MPx220 flip phone solves this problem)</LI>
<LI>Doesn't use Wi-Fi when it's available</LI>
<LI>No FM radio</LI></OL>
<P>It's my understanding that some of these flaws are fixed in the later smartphones (like <A href="http://www.audiovox.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=10001&amp;productId=13758&amp;langId=-1">the Audiovox SMT5600</A>), but even with the issues I mention, I can't imagine that someone with a cell phone wouldn't pick a smart one over a dumb one, nor can I imagine that more then a relative few would prefer a PDA to a smart phone. The smart phone represents a perfect storm of form factor, capability and developer tools. Keep your hands and feet inside the ride, boys and girls, it's going to be a wild ride.</P>
