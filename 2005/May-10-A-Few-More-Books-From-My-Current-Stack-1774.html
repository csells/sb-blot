<h1>A Few More Books From My Current Stack</h1>
<P>Here're some other things I've been reading lately:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>"UML Distilled."</STRONG> This one's useful to figure out which way the arrows are pointing these days and what they're filled with. Or rather, it <EM>was</EM> useful 'til I started playing with the class designer in VS05b2 which rocks <EM>hard</EM>. I was able to switch back and forth between the designer and code views, defining types and members in whichever view I found most convenient at the moment, confident in the knowledge that the other representation would be taken care of properly. It was a <EM>very</EM> satisfying experience.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>"Eclipse Modeling Framework."</STRONG> I find the writing style in this book and the visuals of the tool being described both leave something to be desired, but the potential is there.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>"Building the Data Warehouse."</STRONG> Of the three books on this list, this book is easily my favorite. The writing style is very readable and it's just packed full of useful thinking. Highly recommended.</LI></UL>
