<h1>Wasting the Prince of Darkness</h1>

<p>From &quot;Pete&quot; (not his real name):</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I walked into my first technical interview at Microsoft, and before I 
	could say anything, the woman says, Youre in an 8x8 stone corridor. I 
	blink and sit down. </p>
	<p>Interviewer: The prince of darkness appears before you.</p>
	<p>Me: You mean, like, the devil?</p>
	<p>Interviewer: Any prince of darkness will do.</p>
	<p>Me: Ok.</p>
	<p>Interviewer: What do you do?</p>
	<p>Me: &lt;pause&gt; Can I run?</p>
	<p>Interviewer: Do you want to run?</p>
	<p>Me: Hmm I guess not Do I have a weapon?</p>
	<p>Interviewer: What kind of weapon do you want?</p>
	<p>Me: Um something with range?</p>
	<p>Interviewer: Like what?</p>
	<p>Me: Uh a crossbow?</p>
	<p>Interviewer: What kind of ammo do you have?</p>
	<p>Me: &lt;long pause&gt; Ice arrows?</p>
	<p>Interviewer: Why?</p>
	<p>Me: &lt;floundering&gt; Because the prince of darkness is a creature made of 
	fire???</p>
	<p>Interviewer: Fine so what do you do next?</p>
	<p>Me: I shoot him?</p>
	<p>Interviewer: No what do you do?</p>
	<p>Me: &lt;blank stare&gt;</p>
	<p>Interviewer: You WASTE him! You *WASTE* the prince of darkness!!</p>
	<p>Me: &lt;completely freaked out and off my game&gt; <i>Holy crap what have I 
	gotten myself into.</i></p>
	<p>She then tells me that she asks that question for two reasons. 1) Because 
	she wants to know if the candidate is a gamer (which is apparently really 
	important please note: Im not a gamer) and 2) because she wants her 
	question to show up on some website. I hate to accommodate her, but this is 
	definitely the weirdest interview question Ive ever heard of.</p>
