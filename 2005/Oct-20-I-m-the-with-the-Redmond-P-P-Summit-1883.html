<h1>I'm the "with" @ the Redmond P&P Summit</h1>
<P>Sure, sure, Alan Cooper and Anders Hejlsberg are keynoting, but I'm the "with" at <A href="http://www.pnpsummit.com/">this year's Redmond, WA Patterns &amp; Practices Summit 12/13 - 12/15</A>. I don't yet know what that means, but maybe if I'm enough "with it" in Redmond, it'll lead to "with-ness" in Sydney or Oslo (hint, hint... : ).</P>
