<P><EM>"This solution will take your executable (.Net, VB or C++) and all of its dependencies and wrap them all into a single executable. The neat thing is that it even includes the portions of the .Net framework needed to run your executable inside the executable it creates. So, there's no need to distribute the whole .Net framework."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Has anyone else tried it?</P>
