<h1>I want XBOX Live virtual presence for my PC!</h1>
<P>Robert points out a hilarious video of <A href="http://www.putfile.com/media.php?n=scut">what happens in an XBOX Live session of Halo 2 when the other players find out you've fallen asleep</A>. But, even more interesting than that is the ability for that kind of real-world fidelity to make it into a virtual world so that guys from across the country can all haze the guy in his sleep. I want that for my PC!</P>
