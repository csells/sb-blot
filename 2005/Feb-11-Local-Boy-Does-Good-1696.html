<P>Microsoft's own Robert Scoble has broken his way into the secular press, with an article in both Fortune (<A href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/technology/articles/0,15114,1011763,00.html">Why There's No Escaping the Blog</A>) and The Economist (<A href="http://www.economist.com/people/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3644293">Chief humanising officer</A>). Way to go, Robert!</P>
