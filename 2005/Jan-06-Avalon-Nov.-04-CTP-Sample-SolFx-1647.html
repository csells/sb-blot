<h1>Avalon Nov. '04 CTP Sample: SolFx</h1>
<P>If you've got .NET 2.0 and the Nov. '04 Avalon CTP, <a href="/public/fun/solfx/solfx.deploy">click here to play my scaling, vector-based, WinFX version of Solitaire</A>. Features include lovely scaling of the cards as the window resizes, real-time drag 'n' drop of the cards, sol-like card stacking, ClickOnce deployment and <a href="/public/fun/solfx/solfx.zip">the source</A>. The performance isn't yet what I'd like it to be because I'm loading the card back resource 52 times, but it'll get there. Enjoy!</P>
