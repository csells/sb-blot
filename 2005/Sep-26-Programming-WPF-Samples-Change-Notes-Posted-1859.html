<h1>Programming WPF Samples & Change Notes Posted</h1>
<a href="/wpfbook">Here</a>. I've posted <A href="/wpfbook">the b1 and Sept (PDC) CTP samples and change notes for Programming Windows Presentation Foundation</A> so that you can use the book for either beta 1 or the Sept (PDC) CTP bits and be equally successful. Enjoy.
