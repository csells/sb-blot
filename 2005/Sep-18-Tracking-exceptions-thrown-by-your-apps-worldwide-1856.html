<h1>Tracking exceptions thrown by your apps worldwide</h1>
<P>This is an <A href="http://www.exceptioncollection.com/">interesting, and free, service</A> that you hook your app up to and when it throws an exception, it'll log it w/ the service so that you can track it from afar. </P>
<P>These kinds of services are exactly what web services are wonderful for. Does anyone know of any other such services? I'm embarrassed to say that I don't actually know, but does MS provide one in this space or other developer-oriented web services for other than development?</P>
