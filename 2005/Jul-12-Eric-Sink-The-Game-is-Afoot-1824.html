<h1>Eric Sink: The Game is Afoot</h1>
<P>I don't know if Eric understands the ISV industry or not, but certainly <EM>seems</EM> to. Luckily, I'm on a real product team now, so I get to try to channel Eric into my work.</P>
<P>Eric's latest writing is <A href="http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Game_Afoot.html">The Game is Afoot</A>, in which he describes various games and then draws lessons from them for ISVs. It's fabulous. He concludes by apologizing for the length and then teasing us with the analogies he left off. It wasn't too long, Eric! I wanted more! (I also want your blog to have comments, but that's another thing entirely...)</P>
<P>I think now I understand <A href="/1777">the public outcry when I suggested that I might cut down on the material in the Windows Forms 2.0 book</A>...</P>
