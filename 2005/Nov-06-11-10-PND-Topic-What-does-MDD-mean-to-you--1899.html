<h1>11/10 PND Topic: What does MDD mean to you?</h1>
I haven't been able to hang out at the Portland Nerd Dinners in forever, but <A href="http://nerddinner.com/blogs/portland/archive/2005/11/05/11937.aspx">it's on my calendar for 11/10</A> and my topic is "what does model-driven development mean to you?" I've been doing a ton of experimentation lately and I'm especially interested in how folks deal with a client-model, e.g. data binding, linq, etc, that expects client-server and a middle tier that exposes a service endpoint.
