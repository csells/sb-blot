<P><EM>"Join the Model Engine team and help make modeling a core feature of the Microsoft distributed application platform. We're building an engine and repository that supports a broad range of model domains, from the way we describe the structure of programs and data to the way that pieces of an application work together across machines and platforms. Using models makes it quicker to write programs, simpler to evolve them, and easier to analyze them. Model-driven development represents a major and fundamental shift in the way that software is built and managed; our team is chartered to bring those benefits to the people who are using our platform."</EM></P>
