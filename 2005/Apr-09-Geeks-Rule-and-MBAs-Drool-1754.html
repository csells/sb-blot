<h1>Geeks Rule and MBAs Drool</h1>
<P><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software04072005.asp">Eric Sink takes a long, long time to say the following</A> (learn to let go, Chris [1]...):</P>
<P><EM>"The following is an example of one of the most common questions I get from developers who are creating a brand new software company:</EM></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE class=dtBlock><EM>"Where can I find a partner to be a co-founder and handle the business side of things?</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>"My answer: Don't.</EM></P>
<P><EM>...</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Do all that stuff yourself. You need the experience anyway. If you really want a partner, don't find an MBA, find another geek like yourself. Don't be afraid to allow your company to be very developer-centric for a very long time. By doing it this way, you'll avoid a lot of problems and you'll learn a lot."</EM></P>
<P>Like agile programming, Eric has just given us permission to do what we want to do anyway. Wahoo!</P>
<P>[1] One of my favorite duties at MSDN used to be developmental editing on Eric's writing. I used to love how he'd work certain things into his piece, e.g. the thing my 9-year old son posts on his door, modulo s/Geeks/Boys and s/MBAs/Girls.</P>
