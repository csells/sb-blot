<h1>Viva la IDL!</h1>
<P>I'm sure you've heard the uproar about <A href="http://classicvb.org/">"saving VB6"</A> by now. Since I'm not a member of the VB programmer community, I don't feel qualified to judge them, their tools or their plight.</P>
<P>However, I <EM>am</EM> a charter member of the COM community, so when I hear about <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/midl/midl/using_the_midl_compiler_2.asp">Microsoft's plans to halt the support for IDL</A>, I get burning mad! <A href="http://www.classicidl.org/">Save IDL!</A> <A href="http://www.classicidl.org/petition.htm">Sign the petition!</A> Viva la IDL!</P>
