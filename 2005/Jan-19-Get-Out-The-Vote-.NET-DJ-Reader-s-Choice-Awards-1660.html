<h1>Get Out The Vote: .NET DJ Reader's Choice Awards</h1>
It's time for the annual&nbsp;<A href="http://www.sys-con.com/dotnet/readerschoice2004/vote.cfm">.NET Developer's Journal Reader's Choice</A> awards. Even better, this year <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321116208/chrissells/">Windows Forms Programming in C#</A> has been nominated (yea!). And while it's an honor to be nominated, it'd be an even bigger honor to actually win (my birthday's coming up : ). Voting for MSDN and Visual Studio 2003 would be cool, too. Don't be shy! <A href="http://www.sys-con.com/dotnet/readerschoice2004/vote.cfm">Vote!</A>
