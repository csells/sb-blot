<h1>Dissecting a C# Application: Inside SharpDevelop</h1>
<P>APress has made Dissecting a C# Application: Inside SharpDevelop, the book&nbsp;that describes the history and design of&nbsp;<A href="http://www.sharpdevelop.com/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx">SharpDevelop</A>,&nbsp;<A href="http://www.apress.com/free/index.html">freely available for download</A> and I'm enjoying it immensely.</P>
<P>I've only read the 1st 2 chapters, but the authors have already provided me a nice overview of the major features in SharpDevelop and how they came to be over the history of the project. I'm also very much looking forward to the implementation details later in the book, particularly the add-in model, internationalization, implementing the Windows Forms Designer and, of course, code generation.</P>
<P>For anyone building a real client-side .NET application, <A href="http://www.apress.com/free/index.html">this book</A> is bound to give you clues on how to do it better. Recommended.</P>
<p>And as if that weren't enough, because SharpDevelop is an open source project, if any of the features tickle your fancy, you can <a href="http://www.sharpdevelop.com/OpenSource/SD/Download/">download the SourceDevelop code</a> to see how they were implemented.</p>
