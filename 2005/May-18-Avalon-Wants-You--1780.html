<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"The Avalon team is developing the next generation UI, document and media platform for Longhorn (the next version of Windows). Our group's mission is to transform the development experience and to leverage the immense power of graphics hardware to bring new and compelling features to Windows and Windows applications. We are looking for an individual contributor to help us design and implement an extensible architecture to provide rich Imaging (codecs, effects, metadata, wide-gamut color) and solutions. This individual will work with other groups across the systems division as well as cross-division that are dependent on this functionality. Strong problem solving and cross-group skills are required. Experience with C, C++, C#, and text and imaging/graphics technologies (e.g. publishing tools, Flash, SVG, etc.) are pluses. At least a BA/BS degree in Computer Science or related technical discipline preferred."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
