<h1>Avalon and ASP.NET, Together At Last</h1>
<P><A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/06/28/416185.aspx">Scott Guthrie says</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"What we&#8217;ve set out to do is to make it dramatically easier for anyone to build AJAX-style web applications that deliver rich, interactive, and personalized experiences. Developers should be able to build these applications without great expertise in client scripting; they should be able to integrate their browser UI seamlessly with the rest of their applications; and they should be able to develop and debug these applications with ease.</EM></P>
<P><EM>"For this work, we&#8217;ve been working on a new project on our team, codenamed 'Atlas.' Our goal is to produce a developer preview release on top of ASP.NET 2.0 for the PDC this September, and then have a website where we can keep updating the core bits, publishing samples, and building an active community around it.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then Scott says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"We see Atlas as the best way to write a whole new generation of richer, more interactive, more personalized experiences in browser applications.&nbsp; Avalon is the next generation presentation model for Microsoft, and will let you build the richest user experiences on the Windows platform. Avalon will deliver phenomenal graphical experiences that use the latest in media integration and hardware acceleration. And Avalon will also let you provide persistent, immersive experiences that go beyond the browser.</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Of course, when you&#8217;re building Avalon applications, you can reuse the programming model investments you make today with ASP.NET and Atlas. For example, the ASP.Net Building Block Services and Client Building Block Services will also be accessible from any Avalon client. This model gives you a smooth path to the next generation of applications."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And then I say:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Cool!"</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
