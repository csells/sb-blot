<h1>Avalon + Indigo = Magic @ the PDC</h1>
<P><a href="http://www.douglasp.com/blog/default.aspx">Doug</a> and I will be giving <A href="http://commnet.microsoftpdc.com/content/sessionview.aspx?TopicID=aa50c82e-add2-4138-9374-5b503d67709b">the following talk</A> at <a href="http://microsoft.com/pdc">the PDC</a> this year:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Are you tired of lackluster user interfaces and bit-dropping communication infrastructures that don't work together? If so, then you'll want to see the magic that Doug Purdy and Chris Sells can wield when they build a couple of smart client applications using Windows Presentation Foundation and Windows Communication Foundation. In this talk, you'll be astounded and amazed by the power and simplicity of Doug and Chris, plus they might show you some WinFX, if you ask nicely."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It's midnight as I post this description and Doug has been in my office since 6:30pm working with me on it. If nothing else, it's going to be hella fun for us. : )</P>
