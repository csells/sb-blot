<P><EM>"At this year&#8217;s PDC, we&#8217;ll be hosting our first-ever Show Off event. What the heck is Show Off, you ask? Well, Show Off is an evening event held at the PDC where you can show off your application, tip, tool, technique, animation, or anything cool that can help or inspire other developers. We&#8217;re asking you to submit a short video demonstrating what you want to show off."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
