<h1>Studs from Microsoft</h1>
<P>I have no idea where&nbsp;<A href="http://mentor.creighton.edu/coolstuff/Images/Movies/Sample%20Movies/MISC/STUDS.AVI">the "Studs from Microsoft" video</A>&nbsp;came from or how old it is and I had to download it first before playing it, but it was totally worth it to see Bill Nye as a 'softie and to watch those women run for their lives instead of facing the possibility of dating any of us. : )</P>
<P>[via jj5 (would doesn't like people to know he exists, let alone link to him...)]</P>
