<h1>Early WinFS beta posted for MSDN subscribers</h1>
Not too far behind Indigo and Avalon's beta 1, <A href="http://sqljunkies.com/WebLog/tom_rizzo/archive/2005/08/29/16563.aspx">WinFS posts their own beta 1</A> (although Tom Rizzo, Director in SQL marketing says it may be a tad early). Since their "endgame" is "that WinFS will be in beta when Windows Vista ships," so long as they don't move past beta to RC or RTM (or back to alpha), they've hit it. Congrats! : )
