<h1>Frequent Flier Miles Suck (Airlines Suck)</h1>
<P>I just called to cash in my Alaska Airlines miles on it's partner airline Northwest for a trip <STRONG><EM>5</EM></STRONG> weeks in advance and they told me that they don't have any seats available. I know is complete bullshit, because when I search for the flights on the web directly, they're happy to sell me a seat for the specific day I want.</P>
<P>What they mean is, "Oh no, sir, people actually want to pay to fly that day; we couldn't possible honor our frequent flier commitments to award you travel on <EM><STRONG>that</STRONG></EM> day!"</P>
<P>Blackout dates, "saver seats," coach seats built for pigmes... the whole airline industry sucks and you can tell them I said so!</P>
