<h1>Use IM to Ask Encarta</h1>
<P>If you add <A href="mailto:encarta@conversagent.com">encarta@conversagent.com</A>&nbsp;to your MSN IM contacts list, you can ask it questions, e.g.</P>
<UL>
<LI>What is the size of Mexico?</LI>
<LI>When was Leonardo da Vinci born?</LI>
<LI>How many calories are there in an orange?</LI>
<LI>I want to see the map of Italy.</LI>
<LI>When was Abraham Lincoln born?</LI>
<LI>Solve 2x^2+7x=5</LI></UL>
<P>I especial love the "solve" thing. If I could figure out how to give it simultaneous equations, most of my boys' math home would be solved in IM...</P>
