<h1>Paint.NET 2.0</h1>
<P>And while we're on the topic of real-world .NET Smart Client applications, you can't not take a look at the Washington State University course work resulting in <A href="http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/index.html">Paint.NET, an all-.NET implementation of a painting program</A> that was initially aimed at merely replacing MS Paint Brush, but has long ago far surpassed it with painting features found only in commercial painting applications.</P>
<P>And, like SharpDevelop, if you like what you see and want to know how a feature was implemented, you have only to <A href="http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/downloads.html">download the Paint.NET source code</A>.</P>
<P>Also, don't forget to check back in mid to late January for <A href="http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/plannedfeatures.html">Paint.NET 2.1</A>!</P>
