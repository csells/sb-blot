<h1>What's a group of geeks called?</h1>
<P>Sloth of bears.</P>
<P>Army of ants.</P>
<P>Murder of crows.</P>
<P>Tribe of monkeys.</P>
<P>Embarrassment of richest.</P>
<P>What about geeks? Conference? Shy? Intelligence? Slather?</P>
<p>P.S. <a href="http://rinkworks.com/words/collective.shtml">this site on collective nouns</a> has a bunch of fun ones. I think I like "smack of jellyfish" best...</p>
