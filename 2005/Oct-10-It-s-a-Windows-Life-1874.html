<h1>It's a Windows Life</h1>
<P>A story about <A href="http://www.extremerfid.com/article/If+Microsoft+Never+Existed/162101_1.aspx">how the world would be if MS never existed</A>.</P>
<P>I come from a world where I had a Mac at home and a Unix box at work, giving me the best of both worlds in the late '80s. After that, I got a job at Intel programming Windows 3.1 and wondered why the hell this piece o' crap ran most of the world. 15 years later, I'm a happy Windows user and programmer. Did I change or did Windows?</P>
