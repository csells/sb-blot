<h1>Shepherd Book Wasn't Always A Shepherd</h1>
Aha! I finally figured out where I know Shepherd Book from and I now understand the references to the fact that he wasn't always a Shepherd. At one point, when he was much younger, Book was Det. Ron Harris from <A href="http://www.debw.com/barneymiller.html">the 12th precinct in Los Angeles</A>! I believe the low point in his career was in episode 135 and 136 (a rare two-parter) where <A href="http://www.debwong.com/eps.html">Harris turns a low-budget pornography investigation into a major motion picture</A>. The series only survived another 14 months before Harris changed his name and joined the clergy, eventually ending up on the Serenity. It all makes sense! That Buffy guy is quite the genius... : )
