<h1>Rocky on SOA Versioning</h1>
<P>I don't think that he's saying anything new to the world of message-based programmers, but since so many of us are component-based programmers, <A href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=SOAVersioningCovenant">I like how Rocky bridges the component and message-based worlds and points out the downside of component-based programs in an service-oriented world</A>.</P>
<P>I'm also of the mind that the component-based world isn't even very good for components unless you get to package the components and the apps all at once. For example, in the world I'd like to see plug-in applications like Visual Studio become, where the app and the plug-ins come from different places and version independently, message-based thinking is far more applicable than component-based thinking.</P>
