<P>As soon as corps <A href="http://integrate.factiva.com/search/article.asp?">hire bloggers as part of their marketing budget</A>, they've missed the point completely. Marketing and PR folks are chiefly concerned with only saying the good things about their own products and (the good ones anyway) nothing at all about the competitor's products.</P>
