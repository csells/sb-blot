<h1>Wasting the Prince of Darkness</h1>
<P>80% of the email I get about <A href="/tagged/interview">my Microsoft interview question site</A> (which, 2.5 years into my MS career, nobody has yet forced me to take down) isn't very fun, e.g. asking for the answers (which I don't give) or fairly pedestrian stories ("I got asked some regular questions but didn't get hired.").</P>
<P><A href="/12378">This one</A>, though, is definitely worth posting. Enjoy!</P>
