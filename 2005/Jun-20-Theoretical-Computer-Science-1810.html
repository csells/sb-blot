<h1>Theoretical Computer Science</h1>
<P>accounting is to mathematics as engineering is to computer science.</P>
<P>I'm an accountant sitting in a meeting run by mathematicians. Unless I can use the math to do my double-entry book-keeping, I just don't care. A mathematician cares only for the power of ideas and never needs to see the numbers.</P>
<P>As an accountant, I've read papers written by mathematicians and applied their ideas sparingly, but I've never seen a quorum of them discuss things before.</P>
<P>Fun. : )</P>
