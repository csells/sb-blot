<h1>Episode III: ROTS doesn't suck and other opinions</h1>
<P>My sons and I (and my 11-year old boy's "date!!!") all enjoyed <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/">Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</A>. I know it didn't have much in the way of decent dialog or acting, but when compared to the other 5 in the series (especially episodes I and II), it rocked. I've only seen it once, but right now it's tied for first in my mind with <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/">A New Hope</A> (I know some snobs like <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/">The Empire Strikes Back</A> best, but I still love the feel of the first one).</P>
<P>Also, I liked <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0342258/">Unleashed</A> a great deal. Not only did I enjoy the fighting, but I really enjoyed the relationship between Danny and his new family.</P>
<P>On the other hand, in spite of being a huge Frank Miller fan in general and a <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1878574590/chrissells/">Sin City comic book</A> fan specifically, I couldn't stand <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/">that silly movie</A>. I wanted to see a movie version, not the comic book version projected onto the screen!</P>
<P>In other news, I'm still waiting for a sequel to <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</A>.&nbsp;I don't count <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/">this fan-boy movie</A> or <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/">this one</A>. Anyone got a release date to a follow on worth the time to watch?</P>
