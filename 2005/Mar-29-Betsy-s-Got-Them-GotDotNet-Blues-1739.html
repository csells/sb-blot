<h1>Betsy's Got Them GotDotNet Blues</h1>
<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya">Betsy Aoki</A>, the matriarch of <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com">GotDotNet</A>, sings <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/betsy/gdnblues.aspx">a song of GDN Blues</A>. And not only did she write and sing the song (with a surprisingly good voice for a geek), she also had a hard time getting it published across all GDN servers, further illustrating the point.
