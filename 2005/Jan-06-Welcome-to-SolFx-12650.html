<h1>Welcome to SolFx</h1>
<p>If you've got .NET 2.0 and the Nov. '04 Avalon CTP, <a href="/public/fun/solfx/solfx.deploy">click here to play my 
scaling, vector-based, WinFX version of Solitaire</a>. Features include lovely 
scaling of the cards as the window resizes, real-time drag 'n' drop of the 
cards, sol-like card stacking, ClickOnce deployment and <a href="/public/fun/solfx/solfx.zip">the 
source</a>. The performance in this version is much improved because I'm 
re-using DrawingBrushes and a simplified card back. Enjoy!</p>
