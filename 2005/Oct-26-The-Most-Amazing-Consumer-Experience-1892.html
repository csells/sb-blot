<h1>The Most Amazing Consumer Experience</h1>
<P>I just had the most amazing consumer experience and I just had to share it.</P>
<P>I was looking for the local Mom &amp; Pop computer store in my area and I stumbled across <A href="http://www.puzzlecomputers.com">www.puzzlecomputers.com</A>. His site doesn't mention a store, but I left him a message asking if he could upgrade my computer or point me at the local Mom &amp; Pop. Not only does he do that kind of work, but he came to my house, picked up the two computers I wanted to use as parts, e.g. case, RW-DVD, HD, etc, recommended and purchased the new motherboard, CPU, memory and quiet power supply, put them all together (including modifying my old proprietary Dell case to fit), brought the whole thing back to my house and then spent another hour installing another HD I had lying around. The specs on the parts were 1GB of RAM (upgradeable to 2GB), 2.8GHz AMD processor and ABIT motherboard with all the trimmings.</P>
<P>The whole thing, parts, labor, delivery, etc. cost $400. Plus, he hauled away the extra parts so I don't have to look at them. And when the drivers didn't install right away, he was available for phone support.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. I wish all my consumer experiences were like this one!</P>
