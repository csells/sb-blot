<h1>Programming WPF: Sold Out @ the PDC, More Coming</h1>
<P>All of the initial copies of <A href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/avalon/index.html">Programming the Windows Presentation Foundation</A> have been sold out at the PDC. That's a double edged sword, of course. On the one hand, it's nice that so many people wanted a copy that they were gone by the time I got to see the remaining display copy on Tuesday after lunch. On the other hand, I want the publisher to have provided enough copies to feed a longer buying frenzy.</P>
<P>The good news is that another, larger shipment of the book will be available @ the PDC in the Marketplace store Thursday afternoon. Please form a line in an orderly fashion and keep the sleeping bags out of the normal aisle of traffic. : )</P>
<P>Or, feel free to <A href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/avalon/index.html">purchase one online</A> (or two -- XMas is coming up!).</P>
