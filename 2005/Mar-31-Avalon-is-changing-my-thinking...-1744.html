<h1>Avalon is changing my thinking...</h1>
<a href="/12475">Here</a>. <a href="/12475">This application demonstrates the two things I'm finding that Avalon has changed about my thinking</A>. The first is that data binding makes itself into even trivial Avalon applications and its presence is appreciated. The second is that I want to push as much stuff into XAML as I can. Keeping the data separate from the code makes a bunch of sense and, for my trivial application, keeping the data inline with the rest of the UI was very useful. It allows for easy maintenance and localization while pushing as much of my application into declarations and out of imperative statements. The more I can tell the computer <I>what</I> I want instead of <I>how</I> I want to accomplish it, the better off I am.
