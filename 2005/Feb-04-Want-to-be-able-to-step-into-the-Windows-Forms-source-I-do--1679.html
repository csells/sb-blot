<h1>Want to be able to step into the Windows Forms source? I do!</h1>
Shawn Burke from the Windows Forms team is trying to make the Windows Forms source available for stepping into during a debugging session. Wahoo! He's pretty sure he can give it to us w/o the comments. That's a step up from viewing it via Reflector, imo. Leaving in comments requires all kinds of reviewing work that he may not be able to get to. What do you think? <A href="http://www.shawnburke.com/default.aspx?document=185">Let Shawn know.</A>
