<h1>Airing The Dirty Laundry</h1>
<P>I was sitting at <A href="http://richhubbins.theclaussens.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=25cb78da-09c4-426c-851d-ba4459f6e423">Jim Blizzard's going away party</A> the other night when my phone rang. This was the side of the conversation that the Portland nerds heard:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>"Hello?"</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Well,why don't you have any underwear?"</P>
<P>"Put your brother on."</P>
<P>"Why doesn't your brother have any underwear?"</P>
<P>"Well, why does he <EM>think</EM> he doesn't have any underwear?"</P>
<P>"OK. Put your brother back on."</P>
<P>"Are you sure you don't have any underwear?"</P>
<P>"Look in your hand; is there any underwear in it?"</P>
<P>"Then check your other hand."</P>
<P>"OK, how many pairs of underwear are you wearing?"</P>
<P>"And how many pairs do you need between right now and the time I get home?"</P>
<P>"Good. Bye."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>About halfway through the conversation, the nerds around me could no longer continue their conversations and were laughing openly. Ah, the joys of parenthood...</P>
