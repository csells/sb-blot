<h1>A Coder in Courierland</h1>
I always love reading about people that love their jobs. In this case, <A href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/3/19/133129/548">a Toronto coder gave up half his salary to get out of cubeland and onto the back of a bike as a courier</A>. His descriptions, especially the diary entries at the end, make me pine for the part of my childhood when I'd spend hours on the back of the bike simply because it was the most fun thing I could think of to do.
