<h1>I'm with Shawn -- Constantine was Good</h1>
<a href="http://adoguy.com/content.aspx?id=rantview&rantid=177">Here</a>. After a movie dry spell that's lasted since Thanksgiving, <A href="http://adoguy.com/content.aspx?id=rantview&amp;rantid=177">I agree with Shawn</A> and was pleasantly surprised with <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/">Constantine</A>. I liked it enough that I'd see it again. It's not great, but it's good and the guy playing Satan is <EM>fabulous</EM>.
