<h1>Scott Hanselman's Great .NET Developer Questions</h1>

<p>Scott Hanselman has posted
<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatAGreatNETDevelopersOughtToKnowMoreNETInterviewQuestions.aspx">
a set of questions</a> that he thinks &quot;great&quot; .NET developers should be able to 
answer in an interview. He even splits it up into various categories, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Everyone who writes code</li>
	<li>Mid-Level .NET Developer</li>
	<li>Senior Developers/Architects</li>
	<li>C# Component Developers</li>
	<li>ASP.NET (UI) Developers</li>
	<li>Developers using XML</li>
</ul>
<p>Am I the only one that skipped ahead to &quot;Senior Developers/Architects&quot; to see 
if I could cut Scott's mustard?</p>
