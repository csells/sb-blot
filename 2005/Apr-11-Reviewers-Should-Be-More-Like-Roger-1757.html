<h1>Reviewers Should Be More Like Roger</h1>
If you read <A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0321116208/">the April 10th, 2005 review of my WinForms book</A>, it has one feature that most of the other reviews don't have (and I don't mean pegging me as a "from the VB world" : ); Roger has placed his email address on the review! If everyone did that, I wouldn't spam the 5s, but I would follow up with the 1s, 2s and 3s to see what I could've done to improve the next edition. When I followed up with Roger, he had a bunch of specifics he'd have liked to see me fix. I don't agree with all of them, but you better believe he's on the list of reviewers for the second edition. Thanks, Roger!
