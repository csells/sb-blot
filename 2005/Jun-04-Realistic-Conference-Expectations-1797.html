<h1>Realistic Conference Expectations</h1>
<P>I was chatting today with a friend that complained that he didn't get any deep technical knowledge from a conference talk. I said that he had unreasonable expectations; the most he could expect from a good conference was the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Networking opportunities (hard for geeks; often works via friend-of-a-friend in bars and restaurants, but only if you have at least one friend and s/he has at least two)</LI>
<LI>"Info triggers," i.e. if you attend a 90 minute talk on MSMQ and you're having or are about to have a problem that MSMQ solves well, the talk should a) let you know that MSMQ provides a good solution and b) where to go for more info</LI>
<LI>Entertainment (and that's only the <EM>good</EM> conferences)</LI></UL>
<P>In general, every talk should be structured like so:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Name the thing</LI>
<LI>What's the thing good for</LI>
<LI>A demo of the major use(s) of the thing</LI>
<LI>Here's where to go for more info</LI>
<LI>Any questions?</LI>
<LI>Please remember to tip your waitress</LI></UL>
<P>That's why I really love the idea of <A href="http://www.groktalk.net/">groktalks</A>. If you attend 3 groktalks instead of 1 regular talk, the chances of you finding an info trigger are 3x, while still keeping your networking and entertainment chances even.</P>
