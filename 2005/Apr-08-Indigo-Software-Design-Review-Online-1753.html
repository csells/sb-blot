<h1>Indigo Software Design Review Online</h1>
<P>Gene Webb, Microsoft developer evangelist, has posted <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/genewebb/archive/2005/04/04/405240.aspx">the recorded LiveMeeting Indigo SDR (Software Design Review) dry-run videos and slides</A>. And as if that weren't enough, you can <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20050407INDIGOSS/manifest.xml">see Steve Swartz, Indigo Architect, give an intro to Indigo on MSDN TV</A>.</P>
<P>I remember a day when SDRs were deep, secret mojo that even folks that <EM>knew </EM>about them were special, let along actually <EM>attending </EM>them. Now, we're posting them on the internet. I love my company.</P>
