<h1>Looking forward to the Portland Code Camp, 7/23-24</h1>
<P><A href="http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/pdx/1/sessions.html">The session list for the Portland Code Camp</A>, July 23-24, has just been posted. I'm especially looking forward to the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>.NET Windows Forms Tips &amp; Tricks</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Forensic Development</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Implementing Creature AI</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Introduction to Inform</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Introduction to Python</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Introduction to Ruby</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Ruby on Rails</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>MonoRail - ASP.NET on Rails</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Web Unit Testing with Ruby and Watir</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>That's only if my wife doesn't have my working on the house (we're prepping it for sale). Of course, I don't know if she'll understand that I've volunteered to give my own session: "<STRONG>Some Cool Avalon Stuff</STRONG>"...</P>
