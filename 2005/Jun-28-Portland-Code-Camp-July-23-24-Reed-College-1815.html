<h1>Portland Code Camp, July 23-24, Reed College</h1>
<P>I'm going to be spending my July 23-24 weekend at Reed College attending (and hopefully participating in) <A href="http://www.pacwest.ms/codecamp/pdx/1/">the Portland Code Camp</A>. The manifesto speaks to me:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Code Camps are (1) by and for the developer community; (2) always free; (3) community developed material; (4) no fluff &#8211; only code; (5) community ownership; and (6) never occur during working hours."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Code Camp is looking for speakers and attendees. <A href="http://www.pacwest.ms/codecamp/pdx/1/">Come one, come all!</A></P>
