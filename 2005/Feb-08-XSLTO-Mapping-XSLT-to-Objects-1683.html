<h1>XSLTO: Mapping XSLT to Objects</h1>
<a href="/public/samples/xslto.zip">Here</a>. When Tim Ewald was still a Microsoft employee, he and the next-gen MSDN content management system team experimented with some fun techniques for XSLT to Object mapping. To illustrate this technique, <A HREF="/public/samples/xslto.zip">Kim Wolk has built a little prototype</A> that lets you associate an XPATH statement with a method on an object and that method will be invoked for the nodes that match the XPATH statement. Check it out.
<p />
Update: Steve Dunn has <A HREF="/public/samples/xslto1.1.zip">ported Kim's sample from .NET 2.0 beta to .NET 1.1</A>. Thanks, Steve!
