<h1>Looking forward to "Serenity"</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">IMDB</A>: "8.4/10"</P>
<P><A href="http://www.oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/1127991988181420.xml?oregonian?alfs&amp;coll=7">Oregonian</A>: "A-"</P>
<P><A href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,69036,00.html">Wired News</A>: "And it's those human elements -- the undeniable chemistry between the crew, the tense standoffs between good guys and bad, Mal wrestling with his conscience -- that make Serenity work."</P>
<P><A href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/movies/30sere.html">New York Times</A>: "Scene for scene, 'Serenity' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. "</P>
<P>I never knew about the series while it was new, but have seen it 2.5 times&nbsp;since it came on DVD, loving it all the way through every time (last weekend, we watched it straight through). And not only that, but my family loves it, too, which is why I haven't asked my geek friends to come along to this one with me; this is a sci-fi movie that my whole family is looking forward to. How often does that happen?</P>
