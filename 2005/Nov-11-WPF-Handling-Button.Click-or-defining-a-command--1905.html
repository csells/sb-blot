<h1>WPF: Handling Button.Click or defining a command?</h1>
<P>If I've got an Avalon Button, e.g.</P>
<P>&lt;Button Content="OK" /&gt;</P>
<P>Should I give the button a name so I can handle the event (I would never put the event handler directly in the XAML) like this:</P>
<P>&lt;Button Content="OK" x:Name="okButton" /&gt;</P>
<P>Or, should I define a custom command and invoke it like this:</P>
<P>&lt;Button Content="OK"&nbsp;Command="local:MyDialog.OkCommand" /&gt;</P>
<P>Defining a command seems like overkill (you do some stuff in the static ctor and some other stuff in the instance ctor), but I like consistency, e.g. my main window's menu will use commands.</P>
<P>Thoughts on the best practice here?</P>
