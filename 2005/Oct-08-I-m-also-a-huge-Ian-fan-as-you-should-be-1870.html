<h1>I'm also a huge Ian fan, as you should be</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian Griffiths</A>, my co-author on <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2005/09/16/wpfbook">Programming Windows Presentation Foundation</A>, is very well worth your attention.</P>
<P>He was a colleague of mine at DevelopMentor and now teaches for <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/">PluralSight</A>.</P>
<P>I'm on a private mailing list filled with the smartest people I know and Ian is the one we look to for the definitive word on a wide variety of wacky technologies. In spite of his tendency to write&nbsp;long missives&nbsp;covering&nbsp;huge areas (or because of it), he's the one guy I always read on that list. <A href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/messagesearch?query=%22ian%20griffiths%22">He's also graces the off topic mailing list</A> a great deal and, of course, <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">the blogesphere</A>.</P>
<P>Ian wrote the XAML Appendix that <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/default.aspx">Don</A> so loves, as well as half the rest of the WPF book, including layout, custom controls and resources, all of which I constantly refer to. It goes without saying that his feedback made a huge difference in the quality of my own writing. When I asked Ian to co-author with me, I knew I was obtaining one of the community's most potent secret weapons.</P>
<P>If you're not an <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian Griffiths</A> fan yet, you soon will be.</P>
