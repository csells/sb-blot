<h1>Updater Application Block v2.0 Released</h1>
TheServerSide.NET has a nice summary of <A href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=32583">what's new in the Updater Application Block 2.0</A> from <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=295a464a-6072-4e25-94e2-91be63527327">the new Enterprise Library on GDN</A>. If you're not using ClickOnce from Windows Forms 2.0 yet (maybe because we haven't shipped it yet...), the Updater AppBlock is your next best bet.
