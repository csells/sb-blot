<h1>Hitchhiker's Guide Is Likely to Suck</h1>
<P>It may be that <A href="http://planetmagrathea.com/shortreview.html">this review</A>, saying how terrible the Hitchhiker's Guide move is, is actually funnier than the movie itself. He starts here:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy movie is bad. Really bad. You just won't believe how vastly, staggeringly, jaw-droppingly bad it is. I mean, you might think that The Phantom Menace was a hopelessly misguided attempt to reinvent a much-loved franchise by people who, though well-intentioned, completely failed to understand what made the original popular - but that's just peanuts to the Hitchhiker's movie. Listen."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>He then goes on to detail why the movie is bad, ending up here:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy movie is an abomination. Whereas the radio show, TV show, books and computer game are all recognisably variations on a theme, this is something new and almost entirely unrelated. It&#8217;s not even a good film if viewed as an original work: the characters are unsympathetic, the cast exhibit no chemistry, the direction is pedestrian, the pace plodding, the special effects overpowering (lots and lots of special effects, none of them funny mind you) and above all the script is amazingly, mindbogglingly awful. Oh, and they have taken most of the jokes out.</EM></P>
<P><EM>"This is a terrible, terrible film and it makes me want to weep."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>His obvious anguish makes me laugh. : )</P>
