<h1>The List</h1>
<P>Lord keep me off of <A href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300691.html">the list of people that don't have to go through regular security checks</A>:</P>

<P><EM>"The Aug. 5 memo recommends reducing patdowns by giving screeners the discretion not to search those wearing tight-fitting clothes. It also suggests exempting several categories of passengers from screening, including federal judges, members of Congress, Cabinet members, state governors, high-ranking military officers and those with high-level security clearances."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Can't you just picture the movie where the terrorists kidnap a Cabinet member, hold their family hostage and use them as a mule to blow up some airplane? I'll take the anal probes at the airport, thank you.</P>
