<h1>MS Survey: Partial Trust and Code Access Security</h1>
As Microsoft gets nearer the gate on the .NET Framework 2.0 and ClickOnce, we want to make double-sure we understand if and how you're using/would like to use partial trust and code access security (CAS). It would be a great help for anyone building .NET applications, whether they're web or Windows, whether you're using partial trust and/or CAS or not, to <A href="http://host.ultimatesurvey.com/microsoft/surveys/takesurvey.aspx?surveyid=1030">take this survey</A> so that we can make sure that we've got your needs covered. With ClickOnce, we've come a long way from <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/07/NetSmartClients/">my initial set of No-Touch Deployment complaints</A>, but that doesn't mean we're where we need to be. Thanks for helping!
