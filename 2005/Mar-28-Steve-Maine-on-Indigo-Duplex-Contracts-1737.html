<h1>Steve Maine on Indigo Duplex Contracts</h1>
Steve Maine of <A href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/default.aspx">Brain.Save()</A> has done a really good job on <A href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/PermaLink,guid,460c1f1e-dffc-4a26-a811-57a6e9fd74bf.aspx">the description of a set of duplex contracts in Indigo</A>, i.e. those contracts where callbacks are specified, using the design of a multi-player game of blackjack. Steve shows the service contract interfaces, a bunch of the messaging code and even what's on the wire. Recommended.
