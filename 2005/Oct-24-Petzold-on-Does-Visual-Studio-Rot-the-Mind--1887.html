<h1>Petzold on "Does Visual Studio Rot the Mind?"</h1>
<P>I'm really loving having Mr. Petzold in the blogesphere. <A href="http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html">His latest essay</A> has the following abstract:</P>
<P><EM>Visual Studio can be one of the programmer's best friends, but over the years it has become increasingly pushy, domineering, and suffering from unsettling control issues. Should we just surrender to Visual Studio's insistence on writing our code for us? Or is Visual Studio sapping our programming intelligence rather than augmenting it? This talk dissects the code generated by Visual Studio; analyzes the appalling programming practices it perpetuates; rhapsodizes about the joys, frustrations, and satisfactions of unassisted coding; and speculates about the radical changes that Avalon will bring.</EM></P>
<P>It doesn't end the way I expected it to. Fun stuff.</P>
