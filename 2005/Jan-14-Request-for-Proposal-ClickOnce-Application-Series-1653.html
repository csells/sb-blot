<h1>Request for Proposal: ClickOnce Application Series</h1>
<P>Do you have a series of simple yet compelling ClickOnce applications in you that you can build and deliver to show off the benefits of Windows Forms 2.0 smart clients? Do you have a track record of delivering top-quality code on time and on budget?</P>
<P>If so, <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com">send me a proposal</A>, listing a series of ClickOnce applications, your schedule and your price. You don't have to be a 3Leaf, a PluralSight, a Relevance LLC, a Wintellect&nbsp;or a DevelopMentor (although I'd be happy to hear from those guys, too!). You just have to have a song in your heart, a snap in your step and a story to tell.</P>
