<h1>The Convergence of Documents Media and Application</h1>
<P>Ron DeSerranno, founder and CEO of Mobiform, a company that's been busy building Avalon and XAML tools since the October 2003 PDC, is giving <A href="http://www.techvibes.com/massive/speakerslist.asp?page=2">a talk</A> on how "Avalon in conjunction with XAML will revolutionize the user experience on the web and in desktop applications. XAML and Avalon provide a powerful framework that can provide 2D and 3D graphics, fixed document format, animation and multimedia in a single markup language."</P>
<P>The talk is at the TechVibes MASSIVE 2005 (clearly named by marketing folks : ), March 30th in Vancouver, BC. Drink a pint for me, eh? : )</P>
