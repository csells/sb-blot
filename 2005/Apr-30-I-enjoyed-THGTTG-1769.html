<h1>I enjoyed THGTTG</h1>
<A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">It</A> wasn't perfect, e.g. lots of the fun bits were gone and at least one sub-plot never got resolved, but I liked the new stuff, e.g. the motivation for the end of the movie and the romance. Bottom line: I laughed a lot. We did have a pretty decent local geek turn-out, so that made it even more fun, but it was a completely watchable movie and I'd definitely see it again.
