<h1>Translate C# To And From VB.NET As You Type!</h1>
<A href="http://www.carlosag.net/">Carlos Aguilar Mares</A>, an SDE on the MS Web Platform &amp; Tools team, has created <A href="http://www.carlosag.net/Tools/CodeTranslator/Default.aspx">a fabulous C# to/from VB.NET code translation tool</A>. You can hand it a file and translate in batch mode or you can just type in one language and see it translated in real-time into the other. Now all Carlos needs is a project-wide batch mode and he'd have the problem licked!
