<h1>"dumpbin" is now "link -dump"</h1>
<P>Apparently in Whidbey, "dumpbin" (and some other tools that were merely wrappers around link) has been dumped. To get to it now, do "link -dump -dumpbin_options" e.g. "link -dump -exports" does what "dumpbin -exports" used to do. In fact, if you just do "link -dump" the usage you get is labeled as the dumpbin usage. : )</P>
<P>BTW, it looks like "lib," while still there, is also "link -lib" and "editbin" becomes "link -edit."</P>
