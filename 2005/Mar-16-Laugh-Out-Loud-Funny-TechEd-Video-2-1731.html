<h1>Laugh Out Loud Funny: TechEd Video #2</h1>
OK, the first TechEd video from Scott &amp; Rory ("<A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/RoryAndScottGoToTechEdALoveStory.aspx">A love story</A>") was chuckle funny, but the #2 video ("<A href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/RoryAndScottDesignSomeSoftwareTechEdRevengeOfTheSith.aspx">Revenge of the Sith</A>") was laugh out loud funny all the way through. Recommended.
