What with the public availability of the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=85ab132b-f1aa-4422-b053-272d79863013">Avalon and Indigo CTPs</A>&nbsp;and our stated goal of pre-beta bit releases to gather feedback, you might wonder, "But where should this feedback go?" I'll tell you where to go -- <A href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/default.aspx">the MSDN Product Feedback Center</A>, which now has entries for Avalon and Indigo. Hog pile on the WinFX API product teams!
