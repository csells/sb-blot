<h1>Clemens says "Hello, World" via Indigo</h1>
<EM>"<FONT face=Arial size=2>If you looked at the PDC 2003 Indigo bits, you will notice that <A href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d678ab54-9d39-4fc9-82c0-4e03382d457f">the [Indigo] programming model changed</A> quite a bit. I think that in fact, every single element of the programming model changed since then. And all for the better. The programming model is so intuitive by now that I am (almost) tempted to say 'Alright, understood, next technology, please.'"</FONT></EM>
