<h1>Signs that you may be taking COM too seriously...</h1>
<ul><li>The family pet dies. The best explanation you can give the children is "Fluffy's reference count finally reached zero." <li>You've mailed more than three written petitions to the city council of Enumclaw, Washington requesting that the town prefix its name with an 'I'. <li>Your wife has a rather irritating habit of QI'ing you for IMowsTheLawn, despite the fact that for years you've been returning everything from E_NOINTERFACE to RPC_S_SERVER_TOO_BUSY. <li>The best thing about the new generation of wireless internet devices is that you will be able to receive the DCOM and ATL mailing lists from almost anywhere. <li>Part of your IPO research strategy involves calling the company's engineering manager on the phone and demanding a detailed explanation of apartments and threading. <li>The party you threw to celebrate the introduction of asynchronous RPC calls in Windows 2000 was significantly more expensive than your wedding reception. <li>Last Summer's family vacation to Redmond, Washington. <li>All those emails you've sent to Chris Sells trying to convince him that "ATL Internals" would make a really great movie. <li>Although it is humorous, there are a couple of items in the <a href="#signs1">"Signs you've hired the wrong COM developer..."</a> list that you can't help but view as personally insulting. <li>On your laptop there exists a half-completed manuscript entitled "The Tao of COM". <li>You refer to your Social Security Number as your GUID.</li></ul><p><i>Tony Toivonen <br></i><em>DCOM Mailing List</em> </p>
