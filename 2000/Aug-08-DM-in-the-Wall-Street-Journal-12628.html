8, 2000</span> According to an article appearing in tomorrow's Wall Street 
Journal, DevelopMentor has developed a new technology for creating software 
applications. Attached is a photo of this technology in beta test at 
DevelopMentor's Portland Satellite office. DevelopMentor's device is attached 
to a user and using the latest LFM technology it auto-generates complete 
software applications. Evil Genius, Chris Sells, DevelopMentor's Senior 
Programmer, co-invented the technology with their Security Guru, the Prince of 
Darkness Keith Brown. Says Sells; "[our] new technology holds great promise 
for future generations of code warriors." </p><p align="left"><i>
