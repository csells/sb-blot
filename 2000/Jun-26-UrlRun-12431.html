<h1>UrlRun</h1>

        To deal w/ the number of wrapped URLs I get in my email box, I built <a href="/public/tools/urlrun.zip">
            UrlRun</a>. It checks the clipboard for an URL, no matter how broken, 
        strips spaces, newlines and greater thans out of it and runs IE. To handle an 
        URL as show above, select it, copy it to the clipboard and launch UrlRun.exe. I 
        keep it on my QuickStart toolbar.

        If you happen to be using Outlook 2000 or Outlook XP, Tim Tabor has built an <a href="http://www.cheztabor.com/UrlRunAddIn/">
            UrlRun add-in</a> that does the magic by simply right-clicking on a mangled 
        URL that's you've selected. It's pure sex.
