<h1>Rocky's video series on SQL Server Modeling and CSLA</h1>
Rockford Lhotka has created <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ff381673.aspx">a series of three videos showing how he has applied the SQL Server Modeling</A>, specifically "M", to drive his well-known CSLA, a framework for building the business logic layer in your applications. He shows a custom domain-specific language (DSL) that lets you create a CSLA entity, along with the data serialization, business logic and a forms-based UI, resulting in a 95% coding savings (his words, not mine : ). Enjoy!
