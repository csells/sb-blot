<h1>LINQPad updated to support .NET 4.0b2!</h1>
I'm such a fan of <A href="http://www.linqpad.net/beta.aspx">LINQPad</A> you don't even know. Recently Joe updated it to support Data Services and as of today, if you scroll down to the bottom of <A href="http://www.linqpad.net/beta.aspx">the LINQPad download&nbsp;page</A>, it's been updated to support .NET 4.0 beta 2, which means that you can point it at Data Services constructed with .NET 4.0. This makes my heart sing. Also, if you haven't&nbsp;spent the $29 to get the auto-completion,&nbsp;it's totally worth it. Highly recommended.&nbsp;Thanks, Joe!
