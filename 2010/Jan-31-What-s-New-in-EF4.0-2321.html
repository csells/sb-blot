<h1>What's New in EF4.0</h1>
<P>Soma has posted <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2010/01/11/entity-framework-in-net-4.aspx">a lovely description of what's new in the Entity Framework for .NET 4.0</A>, including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Foreign Key support so you can add a row without requiring you to download an object just to get the foreign key.</LI>
<LI>Lazy Loading support so as you traverse a property that is a collection, the data is pulled on demand.</LI>
<LI>Plain Old CLR Object support (POCO) so that you can build your own classes and have EF serialize those instead of generating new classes.</LI>
<LI>T4-based Code Generation in case you do want classes generated but want to control the code.</LI>
<LI>Data binding support for WPF and WinForms.</LI>
<LI>WCF support with serialization attribute generation.</LI>
<LI>Much better SQL generation so that you can read it better when you need what's going on over the wire and so that it's more efficient.</LI>
<LI>Much better support for complex return values from stored procedures.</LI></UL>
<P>That Soma really knows his stuff! <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2010/01/11/entity-framework-in-net-4.aspx">Check it out.</A></P>
