<h1>Comparing NHibernate and EF4</h1>
This is <A href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/01/Comparing-NHibernate-EF-4">a nice piece comparing NHibernate and EF4</A>. Personally, I'm an EF4 fan, but I'm hardly unbiased and there are definitely features I want to see added to EF v.Next. Either way, it's clear that EF4 is garnering much more appreciation from the community than previous versions and that's because you let us know what you wanted and we added it. <A href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/content/content.aspx?ContentID=14631">Keep those cards and letters coming!</A>
