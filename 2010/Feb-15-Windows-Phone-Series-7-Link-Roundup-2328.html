<img align=right src="http://cache.windowsphone7series.com/images/logo.jpg" />
<P>I was swamped this morning, so didn't get to see the Windows Phone Series 7 stuff live. When I did finally get to poke my head out, Scott Stanfield and Damir Tomicic had the list of links all set for me to follow. Thanks, guys!</P>

<P>Now I just have to let my AT&amp;T contract run out and find a buyer for my iPhone. Can't wait!</P>
