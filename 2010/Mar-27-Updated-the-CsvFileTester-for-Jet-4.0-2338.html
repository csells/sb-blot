<h1>Updated the CsvFileTester for Jet 4.0</h1>
<P>I was playing around building a tool to let me edit a database table in Excel, so I updated <a href="/12415">my CvsFileTester project</A> to work in a modern world, including the 32-bit only Jet 4.0 driver you've probably go lying around on your HD.</P>
<P>Enjoy.</P>
