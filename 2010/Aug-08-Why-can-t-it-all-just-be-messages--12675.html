<h1>Why can't it all just be messages?</h1>
<p>My mobile device is driving me crazy.</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 4.0. Normally when it's driving me crazy, it's standard 
stuff like the battery life sucks or that the iOS 4.0.1 update didn't fix the 
proximity detection or stop emails I send via Exchange from just disappearing 
into the ether.</p>
<p>This time, it's something else and I can't blame the iPhone; I think all 
modern smart phones have the same problem. The problem is that I constantly have 
to switch between apps to see my messages. Here are screenshots for 5 of the 
messaging clients I use reguarly:</p>
<p>

<img alt="Exchange Email" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0072.PNG" width="320">
<img alt="SMS/MMS" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0073.PNG" width="320">
<img alt="Facebook" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0074.PNG" width="320">
<img alt="Twitter" style="margin: 5px;" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0075.PNG" width="320"></p>
<p>This list doesn't include real-time messages like IM, or notifications like 
Twitter or RSS. I'm just talking about plain ol' async messaging. We used to 
think of it as &quot;email,&quot; but really voicemail, email, SMS, MMS, Facebook messages 
and Twitter Direct Messages are all the same -- they are meant to queue up until 
you get to them.</p>
<p>Now, some folks would argue that SMS/MMS aren't meant to be queued; they're 
meant to be seen and handled immediately. Personally, I find it annoying that 
there is a pop-up for every single text or media messages I get on my phone and 
there seems to be no way to turn that off. On the other hand, if I want that to 
happen for other types of messages, e.g. voicemail, I can find no way to turn it 
on even if I want to. Why are text messages special, especially since most 
mobile clients let you get over the 160 character limit and will just send them 
one after the other for you anyway?</p>
<p>iOS 4 takes a step in the right direction with the &quot;universal&quot; inbox:</p>
<p>
<img alt="iOS4 &quot;universal&quot; inbox" height="480" src="/public/spout/messages_0070.PNG" width="320"></p>
<p>Here I've got a great UI for getting to all my email messages at once, but 
why can't it handle all my messages instead?</p>
<p>

<p>Not only would this put all my messages in one place at one time, but it 
would unify up the UI and preferences across the various messaging sources. Do 
you want your text messages to quietly queue up like email? Done. Do you want 
your voicemail to pop to the front like an SMS? Done. Do you want the same 
swipe-to-delete gestures on your voicemail as you have with your email? Done!</p>
<p>Maybe someone with some experience on the new Windows Phone 7 can tell me 
that there is a &quot;messaging&quot; hub that manages all this for me. Since they're 
already doing things like bringing facebook pictures into the &quot;pictures&quot; hub (or 
whatever they call it), that doesn't seem completely out of the realm of 
possibility. If that's the case, I'll say again what I've been saying for a 
while -- I can't wait for my Windows Phone 7!</p>
