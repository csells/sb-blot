<h1>Enabling the Tip Calculator in Your Brain</h1>
<p>I can’t imagine anyone reading this blog needs to read this, but I can’t help myself.</p>  <p>When I was just a wee lad, probably the most valuable thing I learned was how to perform mathematical estimation, the importance of which and several techniques you can get by reading Jon Bentley’s <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/bote.html">The Back of the Envelope</a> (this essay along with several others, are collected in his most excellent books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880">Programming Pearls</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201118890/">More Programming Pearls</a>, both of which are still relevant a decade later). Not only is estimation generally quicker than running a calculator, but even when you do run a calculator, it helps you figure out when you did it wrong, the latter of which has saved my bacon time and again.</p>  <p>For example, as much as I love the Windows Phone 7 marketplace and it’s quality and quantity of applications, the ones that puzzle me are the “tip calculator” apps (several!). I don’t understand why it’s worth the trouble of pulling out your phone and punching buttons when you can know the tip instantly.</p>  <p>For example, let’s assume the dinner bill is $37.42. If the service was bad, that’s a 10% tip (you have to tip them something ‘cuz the IRS assumes you will and taxes them accordingly – bastards). So, with a 10% tip, take the bill and move it right one decimal point: $3.74. Now, round up or down depending on how bad the service was, e.g. $3.50 or $4. Quick and easy.</p>  <p>Assuming the service was great, that’s a 20% tip, so double the bill and move it right one decimal point, making the math easier for yourself, e.g. $37.42 is close to $35, doubling is $70, so a $7 tip. Boom: 20% tip.</p>  <p>If you want to get fancy and provide a 15% tip for good but not great, then average the two numbers: ($4 + $7)/2 = $5.50. Zim zam zoom.</p>  <p>Honestly, as great as the apps are on your phone, tablet or BlueTooth headset (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/2010-02-18-baig18_ST_N.htm">seriously</a>), think about using the apps in your head first. Now only are they quicker and cheaper, but using them staves off dementia (which is <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/">a good thing</a>!).</p>  <p>Oh, and if the tip is added as a mandatory minimum, then the additional tip is easy: $0.00. I don’t deal well with authority.</p>
