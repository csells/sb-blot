<h1>Time to check the donuts</h1>
<img src="http://www.gmailnotifier.com/images/gmail_notifier3.gif" align=right />
<p>One day when I was supposed to be writing, I needed something to do (as often happens). In this particular case, I built a little tray icon app using the new (at the time) tray icon support in Windows Forms (this was a while ago : ). The data I was checking was my gmail account and whenever there was new mail, I'd pop up a notification. All very simple, so to be funny, instead of saying 
&quot;You've got mail,&quot;ï¿½ my program said &quot;I's time to check the donuts.&quot;</p>
<p>Over time, I came to rely on this app but lamented the lack of features, like 
seeing who the email was from or marking an email as read w/o logging in, etc. Over time, I came to wish I had something like
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Gmail-Notifier/3000-2369_4-10914118.html">Gmail Notifier</a>. I's free and while it doesn't contain an 
'80s commercial reference, it has way more features than I ever built into mine. 
Oh, and the noise it makes when you get an email is priceless. Recommended.</p>
