<h1>"Deep Fried Bytes Podcast": Lars on SQL Server Modeling</h1>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class=MsoPlainText><FONT face=Calibri>Here's how the Deep Fried guys describe <A href="http://deepfriedbytes.com/podcast/episode-45-making-sense-of-what-was-oslo-with-lars-corneliussen/">episode 45</A>: "At PDC 2009, 'Oslo' was renamed to SQL Modeling and it left a lot of developers scratching their heads. What better way to sort it all out than to talk with someone deep into the stack. We sat down with Lars Corneliussen to see how this is all going to turn out and it what it means for developers. Definitely an interesting show as it paints a different picture about where things are going with 'M', 'M' Grammar, SQL modeling, Entity Framework, Quadrant and so on."
