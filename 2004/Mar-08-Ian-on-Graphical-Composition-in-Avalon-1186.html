<h1>Ian on Graphical Composition in Avalon</h1>
<P>Normally I like to consume something before I recommend it, but his stuff is always so good that I'm going to point out <A href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2004/03/08/winfs_detail_3.html">Ian's new piece on graphical composition in Avalon</A> before I've even read it. Here's the conclusion to whet your appetite:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"The new composition model in Avalon removes many of the visual design constraints that applied to most Win32 applications. It also improves performance by making more effective use of modern graphics cards, reducing the frequency with which the OS has to call the application back to keep the display up to date, and enabling a much higher quality of user interface."</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Enjoy.</P>
