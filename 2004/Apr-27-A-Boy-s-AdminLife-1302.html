<h1>A Boy's AdminLife</h1>
<a href="http://www.adminlife.com/247reference/default.aspx">Here</a>. A great number of my google searches end up on <A href="http://www.dotnet247.com">www.dotnet247.com</A>, which is a web site that gathers discussions for .NET developers. Matt Reynolds, the proprietor of dotnet247.com has also brought us <A href="http://www.winfx247.com">www.winfx247.com</A>&nbsp;(which I'm sure will be very useful to lots of folks in the not too distant future) and, just recently, <A href="http://www.adminlife.com">www.adminlife.com</A>, which is the dotnet247.com for IT pros/administrators. Myself, I'm looking forward to the day when my 9-year old can administer my network, but for him, I'm sure <A href="http://www.adminlife.com">www.adminlife.com</A> will be a great site. : )
