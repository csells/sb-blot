<h1>Ian on Service API Evolution</h1>
Ian's piece says to evolve an SOA endpoint that you're best off creating and running a new service along side the old one. He takes 2267 words to say what I said in 20, but <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/03/31/serviceevolution">it's still a joy to wind your way down Ian's road</A>. : )
