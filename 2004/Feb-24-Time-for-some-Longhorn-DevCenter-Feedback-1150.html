<h1>Time for some Longhorn DevCenter Feedback</h1>
<P>It's been about 5 months since <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn">the Longhorn Developer Center</A> was launched and I'm curious what you guys think of it. Do you like it? What about it don't you like? How could it support your current Longhorn development goals better? What can I do for the budding Longhorn developers that we're not doing? Don't be shy; call it like you see it.</P>
