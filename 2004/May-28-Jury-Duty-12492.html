<h1>Jury 
Duty</h1>
<p align="left"><i>Friday, <span class="created">May 28, 2004</span></i></p><p align="left">
Today was the first time that I was called to jury duty, even though I've been 
eligible for almost half of my life. I always dreaded being called when I was a 
consultant because the $10/day didn't cover a day's meals, let along the revenue 
I would miss as the sole breadwinner of the family. However, much like the body 
puts off illness when you just can't afford to take the time (stress has its 
uses), my dread seems to have put off my jury duty 'til I had a full-time job 
with enough redundancy to live w/o me for a day or so.</p><p align="left">Even 
when your job pays, most folks seem to want to get out of jury duty in any way 
possible. George Carlin says that the best way to get out of it is to admit to 
the judge that you know how to tell if someone is guilty, &quot;It's all in the 
distance between their eyes...&quot; Personally, I'm a believer in America's system 
of justice (I've often fantasized about a life as a prosecuting attorney and as 
a judge), so I didn't mind serving my turn on a jury. Unfortunately, it was not 
to be. While I went down to the court house, my number wasn't even called to 
appear on one of the two juries needed today.</p><p align="left">Doing a little 
math, I found out that the overall odds of me actually being on a jury were 
actually pretty low. Here are the stats:</p><ul><li><p align="left">47 people 
	showed as potential jurors on 2 juries</li><li><p align="left">28 were 
	called for the 1st jury, of which 12 were needed</li><li><p align="left">15 
	were called for the 2nd jury, of which 6 were needed</li><li><p align="left">
	According to the State of Oregon Washington County Jury Director, 70% of 
	people that show up for a trial see the assembled jury and decide to take 
	the plea bargain after all</li><li><p align="left">Therefore:<ul><li><p align="left">
		Folks called to jury duty that were actually put on a potential jury: 
		91.5%</li><li><p align="left">Percent of juries, once formed, that are 
		used: 30%</li><li><p align="left">People called for a jury actually 
		placed on that jury: 42%</li><li><p align="left">My chance of actually 
		serving on a jury today: 11.5% or less than 1 chance out of 8</li><li><p align="left">
		The opportunity to make the US justice system real for the brothers 
		Sells w/o them actually committing a crime: priceless</li></ul></li></ul><p align="left"><a href="/1371">
