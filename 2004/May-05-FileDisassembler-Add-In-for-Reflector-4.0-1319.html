<h1>FileDisassembler Add-In for Reflector 4.0</h1>
It turns out that the add-in model for Reflector 4.0 is so powerful that it enabled Denis Bauer to build an add-in that leverages the built-in R4 disassembler to <A href="http://www.denisbauer.com/weblog/PermaLink,guid,d8da2708-8e5f-47a1-84ad-2cd81589d3fa.aspx">disassembly an entire assembly into source code files</A>. Very handy for curling up on a sunny afternoon with a chunk of source from your favorite assembly, a cigar and a single malt Scotch.
