<h1>The XAML Clone Wars Heat Up</h1>
There are two companies vying to be your XAML vendor today to help you get read for Longhorn tomorrow. Mobiform released <A href="http://www.mobiform.com/xamlview.aspx">an updated XAML viewer</A> today that can convert from SVG to XAML and show XAML on your existing .NET machines. Xamlon has been on a hiring spree, today bringing on <A href="http://xamlblogs.com/ben/archive/2004/06/28/189.aspx">Ben Cantlon</A>. I don't know Ben, but he's asking for suggestions on what his company can do today to move you to XAML that works on .NET today and Longhorn tomorrow.
