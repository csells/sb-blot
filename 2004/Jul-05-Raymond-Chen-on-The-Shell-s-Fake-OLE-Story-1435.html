<h1>Raymond Chen on The Shell's Fake OLE Story</h1>
<P>Kids these days have it so easy. They expect to do a quick search and bam! the solution is revealed. Like this post from Raymond Chen where he describes <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/05/173226.aspx">the various memory allocators exposed by the shell and COM and how they're related</A>. When I was a boy, we had to figure these kinds of things out! And we liked it! : )</P>
<P>P.S. I really did used to walk to school in <A href="http://www.duluth.com/">3 feet of snow up hill, both ways</A>. I didn't like that at all...</P>
