<h1>Wife Objects To Midget Above The Fridge</h1>
<p>I've spent the last 8 months driving me wife to get rid of a ton of her stuff 
so that we could use more than the front 2 inches of every drawer, cupboard and 
closet in the house (of course, it's her stuff that I find to be extraneous : ). 
Yesterday, while she was on her 2nd night of working 3 12-hour night shifts in a 
row, I sent her the following email (yes, that's <i>just</i> the kind of nerd 
that I am):</p>

<p>The &quot;shiny&quot; stuff above the fridge is all kinds of silver and pewter that we 
never, ever use but <b><i>must</i></b> keep because someone in one of our 
families looked at it once a long time ago. Plus, who knows, the Pope could 
visit to try to convert us back. This was her complete reply after 25 hours of 
work, 6 hours of commute and 6 hours of sleep over 2 days:</p>

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:navy">Is there 
	something that you feel you need to put above the fridge? Are you planning 
	on letting a midget live up there? Because I think that if you are going to 
	let a midget live in the house, they have a right to have a room with a 
	window or something. In that case, you should have them move into the 
	cupboard under the counter in the laundry room and we can knock out a space 
	for a window. It would also be a lot easier for them to get to without 
	having to rig up some sort of ladder, as that would just take up more of 
	your precious space. On the other hand, living above the fridge would give 
	them easy access to the food, and we could have a string with a roll up 
	ladder rigging. Although having easier access to the fridge may make them 
	over eat and they may get wedged up in the space over the fridge, be unable 
	to escape and then we will have to explain why we have that strange odor in 
	the kitchen. </span></p>

<p>Is there any doubt why I love her? : )</p>
