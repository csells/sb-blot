<h1>Interview: Bob Muglia, MS Longhorn Server Sr. VP</h1>
<A href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39148209,00.htm">ZDNet asks Bob Muglia, the Sr. VP in charge of Longhorn Server, questions</A> like: What does MS think about Linux? When will Longhorn client and server ship? What about WinFS? And my personal favorite: Can you tell us what's on Blackcomb's feature list?
