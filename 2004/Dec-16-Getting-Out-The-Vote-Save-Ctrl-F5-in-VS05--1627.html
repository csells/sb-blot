<h1>Getting Out The Vote: Save Ctrl+F5 in VS05!</h1>
<P>When I noticed the behavior that Ian describes in VS05b1 (that <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/12/16/ctrlf5">Ctrl+F5 no longer works to launch a console app with "Press any key to continue..." at the end</A>), I assumed it was a temporary bug. To learn that this feature was removed "by design" is devastating. As a presenter and technology experimenter, I've probably used this as much as any single feature in Visual Studio with the <EM>possible</EM> exception of the text editor.</P>
<P>Don't just site there!&nbsp;<A href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=1cf3309f-971c-4ad1-8da0-f1c88eaca4c5">Vote to Save Ctrl+F5 in VS05!</A>&nbsp;(I love MSDN Product Feedback : )</P>
