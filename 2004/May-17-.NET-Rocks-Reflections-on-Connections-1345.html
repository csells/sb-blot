<h1>.NET Rocks: Reflections on Connections</h1>
Carl IM'd me to see if I could call into a long conference call. I said that I would, but couldn't 'til the brothers Sells had gone to bed (doing the dad thing, don't you know). Anyway, I called and got to swap conference stories with Carl, Rory, Dan, Bill, Mark, Kathleen and Robert. Then they told me <A href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=65">I was actually broadcasting on an episode of .NET Rocks live focusing on conferences</A> and today I got the URL. Ooops. Hope I didn't say anything I shouldn't have... : )
