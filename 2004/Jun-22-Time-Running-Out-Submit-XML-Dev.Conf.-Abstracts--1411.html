<h1>Time Running Out; Submit XML Dev.Conf. Abstracts!</h1>
<P>If you haven't yet submitted your abstract to <a href="/conference">the Applied XML Developer's Conferences</A>, <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Applied XML Dev.Conf. 5 Abstract Submission">don't wait</A> much longer; I'm only accepting submissions 'til the end of June, 2004.</P>
<P>I've already gotten a ton of abstracts, including submissions from folks like Sam Rub, Tim Bray, Tim Ewald and Don Box, but that doesn't mean that your talk won't bubble up to the top; as much as I like to have the polished speakers, I like even more to have the folks from the trenches.</P>
<p>According to current thinking, the conference is likely to be 9/30 - 10/1 within an hour of the Portland Airport, although details are still being finalized.</p>
<P><A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Applied XML Dev.Conf. 5 Abstract Submission">Submit your abstract today!</A></P>
