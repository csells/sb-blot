<h1>This Ain't a Technical Blog</h1>
<P>Just so folks know, I feel no responsibility whatsoever to keep my postings on sellsbrothers.com to a specific topic. If I want to post <A href="/1047">my political views</A>, I'll do so. If that bothers you, I suggest you unsubscribe now as complaints about the subject matter for my posts will fall on deaf ears.</P>
<P>Also, there's an undoc'd feature on my site that might interest folks. I have topic-specific RSS feeds that correspond to the categories of topics that I post. For example, <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/edblog.aspx">the Longhorn DevCenter Editor's Blog</A> is fed from <a href="feed.rss?category=longhorn">http://sellsbrothers.com/news/rss2.aspx?category=longhorn</A>&nbsp;so that only Longhorn-specific topics show up on that page.&nbsp;If you'd like to form your own topic-specific RSS feed URL, I currently use the following categories:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tools</LI>
<LI>Longhorn</LI>
<LI>Spout</LI>
<LI>Conference</LI>
<LI>Fun</LI>
<LI>Writing</LI>
<LI>Money</LI></UL>
<P>However, I post a lot of stuff that's uncategorized and the only way to get that stuff is to subscribe to <a href="feed.rss">the main RSS feed</A>.</P>
