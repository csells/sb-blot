<h1>BBC Coupling: I Laughed 'til I Cried</h1>
<P>The American version left me completely cold, but Melissa and I have just watched <A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/coupling/">the 1st season of the original BBC series Coupling</A> and I actually laughed several times 'til I cried. In fact, there was one phrase that I tried to repeat to my wife because it struck me so hard, but I literally couldn't say it without losing my ability to speak (btw, "the pride of my ear bucket" is the phrase and I'm typing it through the tears).</P>
