<h1>Avoid the GAC (and Check My Reasoning)</h1>
<a href="/12503">Here</a>. <P>The one where I can only come up with <a href="/12503">two reasons for using the GAC</A>, the first being very difficult to pull off correctly and the second to happen more and more rarely as we move to SOA and .NET.</P>
<P>This post feels very much like <A href="http://discuss.microsoft.com/SCRIPTS/WA-MSD.EXE?A2=ind9709A&amp;L=DCOM&amp;P=R8788&amp;I=-3">"Why do we still need duals?"</A> so if you've got a reason for using the GAC that I didn't list, by all means, let me know!</P>
