<h1>Windows Command Shell Partner Drop 3 Available</h1>
For Windows Command Shell (aka MSH aka Monad) users, Partner Drop #3 was just posted today on <A href="http://beta.microsoft.com"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>http://beta.microsoft.com</U></FONT></A>. So far, all I know is that it fixes 45 internally and externally reported bugs, but it's nice to know that things are moving along on the first new shell we've had since NT 3.1.
