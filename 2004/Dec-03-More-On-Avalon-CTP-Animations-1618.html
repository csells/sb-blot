<h1>More On Avalon CTP Animations</h1>
<P>Because Ian doesn't have blog comments and because the Avalon Animation team doesn't yet have a blog, Elizabeth Nelson (PM) and Matt Calkins (SDE) have asked that I post the following response to <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/12/02/avaloncustomanimation">Ian's recent Animating Custom Types in Avalon post</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"I'm happy to report that building custom animations to animate font size is not necessary. (Nevertheless, </EM><A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/12/02/avaloncustomanimation"><EM>Ian Griffiths&#8217;s sample</EM></A><EM> is a spiffy example of how to build custom animations!) For the time being, TextEffects provides just the font size animation tools he seeks. There&#8217;s even </EM><A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/avalon/avnov04ctp/default.aspx"><EM>a TextEffects sample in the Avalon CTP Announcement</EM></A><EM> that Arik, Karsten and Tim put together.</EM> <EM>The properties of interest for font size animations are ScaleX and ScaleY.</EM></P>
<P><EM>"This isn't the end of the story on Font animations -- we&#8217;re still working on hooking a few things up internally to make it easier to use animations. Regardless of what else we cook up for built-in Font animations, TextEffects will come in handy for animating individual characters in a string in a coordinated manner.</EM></P>
<P><EM>"As for the concern about rendering artifacts when enlarging text, the issue is definitely on our radar!</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Thanks for your enthusiasm for custom animations."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
