<h1>Looking for Genghis Co-Khan</h1>
Right now, I'm holding <A href="http://www.genghisgroup.com">the shared source Genghis library</A> back. I'm acting as sole arbiter of what makes it into Genghis and how and I'm not able to keep up with the flow. I'm looking for someone who's interested in sharing this duty with me. Only proven contributors to the Windows development community need apply.
