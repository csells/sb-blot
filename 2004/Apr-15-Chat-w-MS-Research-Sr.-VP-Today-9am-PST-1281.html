<h1>Chat w/ MS Research Sr. VP Today @ 9am PST</h1>
<a href="http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/zforum/04/sp_technews_Rashid041504.htm">Here</a>. <P>This seems a nice change from the tedium of paying taxes to the man:</P>
<P>"Rick Rashid, a senior vice president at Microsoft, will be online to take questions about innovation at Microsoft and the company's research and development efforts. ... Join Rashid online on April 15 from 12 to 1 p.m. ET for a discussion on Microsoft and its current research plans, goals and challenges."</P>
<P>It looks like <A href="http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/zforum/04/submit_sp_technews_Rashid041504.htm">you can submit your questions in advance and that this is the same place where the chat will happen</A>, but it's darn hard to tell.</P>
