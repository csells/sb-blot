<h1>Avalon Property Invalidation & Custom Measurement</h1>
This post is an oldie, but a goody, in which <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/digitalnetbizz/archive/2004/03/14/89626.aspx">Kenny Lim talks not only about custom Avalon controls catching property changes so that they can re-render themselves, but also about the custom measurement sequence</A>, which is a core piece of a control that does custom layout like, say, a pile of cards (hypothetically, of course : ).
