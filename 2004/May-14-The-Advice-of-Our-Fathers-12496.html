<h1>The Advice of Our Fathers</h1>
<p align="left">
Being a Midwesterner, my father is a fairly stoic man and, unlike his son, 
doesn't often speak just to hear the sound of his own voice. Still, I've managed 
to pick up a few gems over the years that my own sons are now forced to hear 
often, like &quot;If something is worth doing, it's worth doing well,&quot; &quot;It's the hard 
things that are worth doing,&quot; and &quot;It's easy to figure out the right thing to do 
-- it's the hardest&quot; (do you detect the Midwest work ethic in any of these 
sayings? : ).</p><p align="left">When I was having trouble with a pair of 6th 
graders (I was a 3rd grader), he said, &quot;Don't start a fight, but make sure that 
you <i>end</i> it&quot; (<i>that</i> was hard to implement...).</p><p align="left">
When I went off to college, he said, &quot;Don't go to bed drunk&quot; (I always regret it 
when I ignore this piece of advise...).</p><p align="left">When I broke 
something of my wife's and wasn't contrite enough, my father, working on wife #3 
at the time, said to me, &quot;You've got to be <i>nice</i> to your wife!&quot;</p><p align="left">
But the one that sticks with me most, the one I hear in my head almost every 
time I make a sandwich (and the one that caused me to write these words) is 
&quot;Don't get the God Damn jelly in the God Damn peanut butter!&quot; To this day, with 
my father 1500 miles away in Fargo, I still make sure that there's no jelly on 
my knife when I reach for the peanut butter.</p><p align="left">It's funny what 
unintended impressions you leave on people. I wonder what about me will haunt my 
children?</p><p align="left"><a href="/1338">
