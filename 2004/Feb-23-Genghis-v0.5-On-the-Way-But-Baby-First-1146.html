<h1>Genghis v0.5 On the Way, But Baby First</h1>
<a href="http://genghisgroup.com">Here</a>. <P>For those folks asking, another drop of Genghis is on the way, which includes an HTML link class that handles links for you, a&nbsp;user-sizeable panel, a gradient progress bar, a completely revamped FileDocument and a host of fixes and enhancements, including stacking support and terminal server support for toast windows. However, before that can come, Mike Marshall, the Genghis build-master, stopped to email me about the impending arriving of his first child. Now *that's* dedication! I doubt if I'd stop to email any of the folks in charge of the shared source projects I'm involved with on the way to the hospital... : )</P>
