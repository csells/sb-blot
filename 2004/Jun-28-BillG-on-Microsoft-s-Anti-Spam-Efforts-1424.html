<h1>BillG on Microsoft's Anti-Spam Efforts</h1>
It's pretty cool for to see industry competitors, Microsoft, AOL, Earthlink, etc, to work together against <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/execmail/2004/06-28antispam.asp">a common foe: spammers</A>. This gives me hope that warring nations will be able to band together when the alien invasion comes. : )
