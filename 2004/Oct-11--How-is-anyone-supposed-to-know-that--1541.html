<h1>"How is anyone supposed to know that?"</h1>
<P>The high priests that run the Internet and the IT industry have betrayed the trust of the secular community.</P>
<P>My wife called me over to her computer the other day when she was worried about an email stating a problem with her eBay account. By reflex, I said, "Oh, just ignore that."</P>
<P>"What? Why? They're going to shut off my eBay account," she said, motioning me over more urgently this time.</P>
<P>Looking over her shoulder, I saw an email that looked very official, including the eBay logo.</P>
<P>"See?" she pointed at the From line. "It's from ebay.com."</P>
<P>"I know, sweetie, but hang the mouse over the link they want you to click. It's a number; it's not ebay.com"</P>
<P>Looking at me like I'd just broken the news about Santa Claus, "But how is anyone supposed to know that?"</P>
<P>I didn't have an answer. There really should be one.</P>
