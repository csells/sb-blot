<h1>Applied XML Dev.Conf. 5 Web Sightings</h1>
<a href="/public/conference/#sightings">Here</a>. I got so tons of positive feedback during <A HREF="/public/conference/">the DevCon</A>&nbsp;about the talks, the venue, the format, etc, for which I thanked each person sincerely. However, <A HREF="/public/conference/#sightings">the huge number of DevCon-related posts on the web</A>, including <A href="http://www.devsource.ziffdavis.com/article2/0,1759,1681545,00.asp">a reporter's piece on DevSource</A>, was overwhelming.
