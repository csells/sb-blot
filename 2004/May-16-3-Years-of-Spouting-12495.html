<h1>3 Years of Spouting</h1>
<p align="left"><i><span class="created">Sunday, May 16, 2004</span></i></p><p>
Yesterday was my 3rd anniversary of The Sells Spout. It's hard to remember back 
that far, but this was before any wide-spread blogging software, either client 
or server, before RSS and before personal email addresses were rendered nearly 
useless by 157 messages/day about how to enlarge our genitalia, necessitating 
the eventual move away from newsletters.</p><p>At the time, I used FrontPage and 
&lt;a name&gt; tags to run my blog. I still use FrontPage + &lt;a name&gt; tags, but I also 
use web forms and SQL Server to track comments and generate RSS. In general, I 
see my site as a giant, categorized blog, e.g. Tools, Fun, Spout, etc, with a 
front page of descriptions of the items I add to my site and of interesting 
things I find in the world.&nbsp;Towards that end, I'd like to rebuild my site from 
scratch using some kind of content management system so that I can get a bunch 
of flexibility that I don't have now, e.g. referral logs, auto-archive pages, 
comment notifications for me, rich comments, a smart client front end for 
reading from -- and adding content to -- the site, etc. I could add all of that 
to my own homebrew software, but I'd prefer to use something like .Text. In 
fact, assuming ScottW integrates .Text into ASP.NET 2.0, rebuilding my site with 
both is something that I've very likely to do.</p><p>The site itself is 9 years 
old, but my normal outlet of tools, code samples and technical writing wasn't 
enough for me, so 3 years ago, I started editorializing on The Sells Spout. I 
don't know what my site traffic was 3 years ago, but I know it's grown 
ridiculously since then for no reason that I can discern. For example, last 
month my site served 885K sessions and 2.5GB in small pages, zip files and RSS 
feeds. While full 55% of the page hits were the RSS feeds (quite a number of you 
are keeping a close eye on me, apparently), that left 398K people/month visiting 
my site to read or respond to a topic from my blog (18.7% of the total), read 
about interviewing at Microsoft (10.6% of the total) or download a tool (4% of 
the total).</p><p>BTW, for those of you who would point out that my RSS feed is 
syndicated as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/edblog.aspx">
the Editor's Blog</a> for <a href="http://msdn.com/longhorn/">
the Longhorn Developer Center</a>, throwing off my site stats because of the 
traffic on the DevCenter itself, I'll counter with one word: caching. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/ksharkey">
Kent Sharkey</a>, the editor of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/">
the ASP.NET Developer Center </a>and expert in all things ASP.NET, has built 
caching into the control that displays the Editor's Blog from my RSS feed. Since 
it's set to 60 minutes of cache per server and hosted on the 11-server MSDN web 
farm, that's at most 8184 sessions/month to serve my RSS feed on msdn.com.</p><p>
I don't really know what draws that many people to my site, but 3 years ago, I 
stated <a href="/12613">
my rules of engagement</a> as follows:</p><li>I want to <b>make people's lives 
better</b>. </li><li>I'm interested in <b>putting food on my table</b>. </li><li>
I'm interested in <b>what I'm interested in</b>. <p>After 3 years, my agenda 
remains the same. I find that strangely comforting.</p><p><a href="/1344">
