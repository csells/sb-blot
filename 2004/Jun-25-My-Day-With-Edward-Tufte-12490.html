<h1>My Day With Edward Tufte</h1>
<p><i><font face="Times New Roman">Friday, <span class="created">June 
25, 2004</span></font></i></p><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">I spent most of Thursday in a seminar given by <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/">
Edward Tufte</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Tufte,%20Edward%20R./">
the author of several seminal books in the area of data analysis and 
presentation</a> (with another, Beautiful Evidence, in the works). I enjoyed it 
thoroughly and here's what I was able to capture:</span></font></p><h2><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
Tufte's Grand Principles</font></h2><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">The goal of good information design is to <b><span style="font-weight: bold">
minimize the amount of time spent figuring out the design</span></b> of the 
presentation of information (or even admiring it) and <b><span style="font-weight: bold">
maximize the time spent reasoning about the information</span></b>. Good designs 
should be as nearly invisible as possible.</span></font></p><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Tufte: &quot;The point of an information display is to assist thinking. Good 
design is clear thinking made visible. Bad design is stupidity in action. Chart 
junk is a good sign of statistical stupidity.&quot;</span></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman">
My </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">favorite Tufte term is what he calls designers brought in to make boring 
numbers look interesting: &quot;chartoonists.&quot;</span></font></p><h2><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; ">
Ed's Grand Principles of Analytical Design</span></font></h2><ol><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Show</span></b> <b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	comparisons</span></b> (this is big theme of Tufte's)</span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Show</span></b> <b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	causality</span></b></span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Show more than 2 variables, as the <b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	world we're trying to understand is multivariate</span></b></span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Integrate word, number and image</span></b> 
	(this is another big theme)</span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Say from where the data came</span></b></span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">The value of an information presentation comes from <b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	the quality, the relevance and the integrity of the content</span></b>, i.e. 
	good design won't fix bad content.</span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Use <b><span style="font-weight: bold">small multiples</span></b>, e.g. 
	showing multiple pictures of sunspots on the sun over time</span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Show and embed scales of measurement</span></b> 
	because it's an essential part of the context</span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Annotate everything </span></b>and if 
	the audience reads ahead  great, they're reading your material</span></font></li><li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Use proven design templates</span></b> 
	(like those in Tufte's books)</span></font></li></ol><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Tufte: &quot;Don't let the marketing people corrupt your presentations by 
eliminating detail. Chances are, the people looking at the information know more 
than the marketing people. People haven't suddenly gotten stupid just because 
they come to hear you talk. If people can read the financial tables and the 
sports tables from the paper, they can get read data from you.&quot; (The last point 
assumes a good design.)</span></font></p><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">In my own work, I often remove detail for clarity, but I'm very careful 
to leave enough details to keep context. I admit, it's a fine like to walk and 
hard to get right.</span></font></p><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">As a way to pack more data into a small space (and in an attempt to 
secure his immortality, imo), Tufte was inspired by Galileo's work to create a 
new kind of graphic meant to be integrated into a sentence as yet another word. 
He calls them &quot;<a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001Eb&topic_id=1">sparklines</a>&quot; 
(the sparkline is the graphic before each word):</span></font></p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/sparklines.gif" width="184" height="88"></p><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Sparklines pack a lot of information into a small space and are a cool 
alternative to graphics that break the flow of thought and need to be called out 
with a phrase like &quot;as seen in Figure 3.&quot; I have a mind to implement them in 
Avalon when I get a chance.</span></font></p><h2><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
90% Content</font></h2><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Tufte hates most kinds of user interfaces because they spend too much of 
the already low resolution screen on &quot;fluff,&quot; e.g. menu bars, captions, 
navigation, etc, and too little on the content itself. As an example, he showed 
a screenshot of a photo display app that used only 18% of the screen for the 
actual photos. He wants nearly invisible operating systems and apps and 90% of 
the screen used for the content. He's a big fan of <a href="http://www.google.com/news">
Google News</a> as a way to pack in a lot of information and he's a big fan of 
scrolling. For web sites, Tufte recommends only a small set of links at the top 
of each page for navigation and nothing else. <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/">
His own site</a> is like this and I have to admit, I like it.</span></font></p><h2><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
Design For High Resolution</font></h2><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Ed hates low resolution. He wants everyone to design for high resolution 
to be viewed at 22 inches so you can pack a lot of information in, showing 
comparisons and causality. He hates PowerPoint because it's made to be viewed 
from 22 feet and doesn't provide a lot of room for showing dense data, 
comparisons or causality. It's far easier for humans to make judgments when they 
can see everything at once instead of sequenced one slide after another (or &quot;one 
damn thing after another,&quot; as Tufte says : ). In general, he believes everything 
should be printed and that PowerPoint should only be used for showing pictures 
to an art class. I see his point, but ironically, when he wrote <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint">
a paper on the problem of PowerPoint</a> to be read at 22&quot;, after 3 pages of him 
blaming PowerPoint for sloppy thinking, I put it down in disgust. If he had had <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000931">
his thoughts put together into PowerPoint-style format</a>, I could have skipped 
ahead to find his real point, i.e. low resolution makes it hard to do serious 
analysis.</span></font></p><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">As a point for Tufte, when producing this summary of my day listening to 
him, I'm mixing prose, images and references, but I'm not producing it in 
PowerPoint. According to Tufte, 4 pages of prose is equivalent to between 50-250 
PowerPoint slides and I have to admit, it would be hard to convey what I want to 
say about him in a PowerPoint deck without using a lot of slides and throwing 
away the subtleties. In general, I believe that PowerPoint is best for reminding 
the presenter what they want to say and is very poor for the audience. Instead 
of a slide presentation, Tufte recommends providing the audience 4 pages of 
prose, which they read 3-5x as fast as you could say it, and then having a 
conversation. Interestingly, he allowed no conversation during his own 
presentation but instead talked to various parts of his books and hand-outs.</span></font></p><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">&nbsp;On the other hand, has anyone even read this far? Would you have gotten 
farther if I'd have summarized everything in slides, skipping ahead to the juicy 
bits when you got bored?</span></font></p><h2><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
Giving Presentations</font></h2><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Tufte has a great deal of advice about how to prepare for and give 
presentations. To prepare, you must have great content (no amount of design or 
practice will fix bad content) and spend a great deal of time practicing 
(especially important if you're not using PPT to remind you what to say). When 
presenting, follow these rules (these aren't all of my rules, but I agree with 
them):</span></font></p><ol><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Show up early</span></b> 
	to avoid problems and greet everyone at the door to learn their names, 
	introduce yourself and begin advancing your cause</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	Start talks with The Problem, Why They Should Care and The Solution</span></b></li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	Never start your talk with an apology</span></b>, as it just make you look 
	pitiful</li><li><b>Use Particular/General/Particular when presenting 
	information</b>, e.g. start with a particular example of something, 
	generalize it and then show another particular example that shows the same 
	general characteristics (I use this technique all the time and it's very 
	effective)</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Use first person 
	singular only to express opinion</span></b>, i.e. this isn't a talk about 
	you but about a serious topic</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	Give everyone at least one piece of paper</span></b> (Ed prefers a single 
	11&quot; x 17&quot; folded in half with 4 sides of content)</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	Knowing your content and respecting your audience</span></b> is more 
	important than knowing your audience if by &quot;knowing&quot; them, you &quot;dumb down&quot; 
	your talk for them</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Avoid project 
	slides</span></b> (aka PowerPoint or the equivalent)</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	Use humor as appropriate</span></b>, e.g. hyperbole to make a point, <b>but 
	don't tell jokes</b>. &quot;Don't alienate your audience because of a joke. 
	Alienate your audience on the merits on your content!&quot;</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	Avoid the use of &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she,&quot;</span></b> e.g. &quot;The user, he takes his 
	mouse and moves it to his menu bar where he makes his <i><span style="font-style: italic">
	manly</span></i> choice.&quot; <b>Use &quot;they&quot; instead.</b></li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">
	Make sure folks know you believe what you're saying</span></b> by getting 
	out from behind the podium, getting close to people and use appropriate 
	gestures. If you don't believe what you're saying, they're not going to 
	believe it.</li><li><b><span style="font-weight: bold">Finish early</span></b> 
	and something good will happen. No one will ever look at their colleague, 
	commenting on how they wish you had gone on for another 20+ minutes.</li></ol><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:
12.0pt">I think that Ed has enough good things to say about how to approach the 
presentation and analysis of data that I would recommend that pretty much anyone 
involved in the presentation and analysis of information take the time and 
attend his day-long seminar.</span></font></p><p><a href="/1417">
