<h1>Where Are You In The Software Practitioner Triad</h1>
<P>In his piece <A href="http://www.ftponline.com/vsm/2003_09_14th/magazine/departments/softwarearchitect/default_pf.aspx">Software Practitioner Triad</A> (I know it's old, but I just got <A href="http://www.philweber.com/2004/06/26.htm#a115">pointed to it by Phil Weber</A>), Alan Cooper points out three different folks needed to design and build software:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Architect</STRONG>: responsible for determining who the user is, what he or she is trying to accomplish, and what behavior the software must exhibit to satisfy these human goals.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Engineer</STRONG>: technical problem solving via experimentation, not fettered with the demands of producing release code.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Programmer</STRONG>: producing a shippable product, consisting mostly of protective code that rarely&#8212;if ever&#8212;executes, but is dedicated to supporting obscure edge cases, platform idiosyncrasies, and error conditions.</LI></UL>
<P>I've done all three, but am happiest with architect and engineer. Where are you in your current job? Where do you want to be?</P>
