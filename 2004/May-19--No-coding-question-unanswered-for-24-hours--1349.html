<h1>"No coding question unanswered for < 24 hours"</h1>
<a href="http://richhubbins.theclaussens.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=982b8ede-9785-4313-b18a-9f188538de4f">Here</a>. <P>After the official question was discussed for a good long time -- "What more can MSDN do for developers?" -- I asked this follow-up question in 3 parts:</P>
<OL>
<LI>How many of you are <STRONG>unsatisfied</STRONG> Microsoft developers? 0 hands raised</LI>
<LI>How many of you are <STRONG>somewhat satisfied</STRONG> Microsoft developers? 0 hands raised</LI>
<LI>How many of you are <STRONG>very satisfied</STRONG> Microsoft developers? 30 hands raised</LI></OL>
<P>After the session, one Portland nerd came up and told me that he can't remember the last time that he had a coding question that went unanswered for more than 24 hours. Wow. We'd come quite a ways when that's the case.</P>
