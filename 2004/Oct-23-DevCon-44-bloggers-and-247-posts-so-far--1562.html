<h1>DevCon == 44 bloggers and 247 posts (so far)!</h1>
<a href="/public/conference/#Sightings">Here</a>. Holy cow! I knew people liked the DevCon, but <A HREF="/public/conference/#Sightings">I've never seen a blogging response like this</A>. I've found 44 separate bloggers and 247 posts related to the event itself (not counting the warm-up to the event). That's almost 6 posts/blogger or 2 posts/attendee! Good lord, but these were a prolific bunch...
