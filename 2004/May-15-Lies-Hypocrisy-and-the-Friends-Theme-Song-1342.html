<h1>Lies, Hypocrisy and the 'Friends' Theme Song</h1>
<P>As much as I love the Friends show for it's portrayal of unconditional love (as a geek, people loving me no matter what I do is appealing), I have to admit that it works best on a backdrop of few money worries (Monica's apartment is worth <EM>$6000/month</EM>?!? No wonder I don't live in NYC...). <A href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=1874924">NPR's Mike Pesca opens up my eyes to the lies and hypocrisies (hyprocrisi? [see? geek!]) in the Friends theme song and is hilarious about it</A>.</P>
