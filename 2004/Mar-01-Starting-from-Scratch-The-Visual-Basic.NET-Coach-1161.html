<h1>Starting from Scratch: The Visual Basic.NET Coach</h1>
Sometimes I get aspiring programmers stumbling onto my web site and asking me how to get started having no programming background. I can't really tell them to do what I did, i.e. spend 4 years programming Applesoft Basic, so instead <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321113500/chrissells">I recommend "The Visual Basic .NET Coach,"</A> which is supposed to introduce .NET programming from the ground up, assuming no previous programming experience. Does anyone have any experience with this book or other similiar titles?
