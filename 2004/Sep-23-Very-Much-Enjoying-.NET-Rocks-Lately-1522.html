<h1>Very Much Enjoying .NET Rocks Lately</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/">DNR</A> goes up and down like every other media outlet (it's not unlike this very web site in that way), but I've really been enjoying it muchly lately. Not only did I get to hear someone besides <A href="http://www.pluralsite.com/">my normal brethren</A> talk about CAS in a way that didn't make my flinch (<A href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=79">Don Kiely on developing with least privilege</A>), but I also got to listen to <A href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=81">Mark Miller</A> talk (at break-neck speeds) about my Dad freaking out when the jelly got into the peanut butter at the same time he was enthusing about CodeRush and telling Rory that he didn't need counseling to deal with his relationship problems, he needed penicillin. Fabulous.</P>
