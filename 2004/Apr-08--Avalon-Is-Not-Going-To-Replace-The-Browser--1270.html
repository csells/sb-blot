<h1>"Avalon Is Not Going To Replace The Browser"</h1>
<P>There seems to be a common misconception that since Avalon windows/pages are/can be declared in markup (XAML), it must be a web killer/reach solution. It's not.</P>
<P><A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=948">In this short video</A>, Joe Beda, answers the question of whether Avalon is meant to replace HTML/the web (it's not) and what's Avalon's message of "best of the web/best of Windows" message is really about, e.g. ease of deployment for Avalon apps like web apps, accessing central services for data and functionality (using web services instead of client UI generation), etc.</P>
