<h1>The Hallowed Halls of MSDN Quiz</h1>
<P>Matt Powell has posted <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/Mpowell/archive/2004/04/15/114312.aspx">a quiz about MSDN</A> based on <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2949">the video tour Channel9</A> posted yesterday. These questions were kind of embarrassing:</P>
<P>"1.&nbsp;According to Chris, what does PAG stand for?</P>
<P>"2. What does PAG really stand for?</P>
<P>"Extra Credit: Of the 100 people that make up MSDN, how many of those people are part of PAG?"</P>
<P>I knew that the odds of me getting the PAG acronym right were small, but I think I got the *spirit* of it right... I haven't been this sheepish since Sara, the Matriarch of MSDN, had to remind me that I was a Content *Strategist* not a Content *Specialist* after my first public posting. : )</P>
