<h1>XAML as Documents</h1>
<P>Wes muses on <A href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2004/01/xaml_as_documen.html">whether XAML could become a "standard" document format</A>&nbsp;for even custom types. Certainly, if a document was serialized in XAML using custom types instead of in a custom format, it would save some translation to/from the Avalon object model...</P>
