<h1>Edward Tufte + Avalon == Visualization Goodness</h1>
<P>I've long held the belief that the big deal about Avalon is that it provided a platform for a whole new class of data visualization and manipulation software, stuff that most of us can't even dream of right now. But <a href="/12490">Edward Tufte can dream of it</A> and in one of his dreams, he invented Sparklines, a very nice way to integrate graphics directly into a sentence instead of relegating it&nbsp;to a whole other paragraph.</P>
<P>As evidence of the power of Avalon to enable the next-gen UI, Sean Gerety has provided <A href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/metablog/archive/2004/12/03/34896.aspx">an Avalon implementation of Sparklines</A>. Excellent work, Sean.</P>
