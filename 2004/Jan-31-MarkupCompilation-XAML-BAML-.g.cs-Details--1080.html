<h1>MarkupCompilation: XAML, BAML, .g.cs Details </h1>
<P>Rob Relyea, a Lead PM on the Avalon team, <A href="http://longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/archive/2004/01/31/2306.aspx">posts some history of XAML as well as a description of how it's compiled into BAML and then into code</A>. He also talks about CAML, which is used today in the PDC bits, but going away in the future.</P>
<P>I love these kinds of posts (and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnavalon/html/avalon01062004.asp">these kinds of articles</A>) because they provide insight into what the designers of a particular technology had in mind, making it <EM>so</EM> much easier to learn. Having spent <EM>years</EM> of my life reverse-engineering the intentions of the COM designers out of the header files (because the docs and marketing materials actually pointed us in the wrong direction), it's great when the folks behind the technology spill their guts. Thanks <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com">Chris</A> and Jeff and <A href="http://longhornblogs.com/rrelyea">Rob</A>&nbsp;(and <A href="http://anopinion.net/">Mike</A> and <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx">Don</A>&nbsp;and the rest of the MS bloggers).</P>
