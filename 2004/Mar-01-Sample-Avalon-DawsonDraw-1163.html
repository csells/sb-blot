<h1>Sample: Avalon DawsonDraw</h1>
<P>Ryan Dawson posts <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rdawson/archive/2004/02/27.aspx">a nice sample showing the basics of a drawing program in Avalon</A>, including a floating toolbar and the ability to draw and select lines, rectangles and circles. He also provides the source.</P>
<P>BTW, Ryan's pretty darn prolific on Longhorn and <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rdawson/">I recommend his blog</A> in general. Also, if I remember correctly, he's 19, so you're getting pure enthusiasm and uncensored truth. Recommended.</P>
