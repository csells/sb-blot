<h1>Getting Started with Your Own Software Company</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software01262004.asp">Here</a>. <P>Eric Sink talks about starting your own company. More specifically, he recommends that you don't do it unless you're absolutely sure that's what you want to do. Having started several businesses in my time, a couple of things really resonate:</P>
<P>"In the business world, ideas are worthless. Real value comes from good execution."</P>
<P>and</P>
<P>"The developer tools market offers the worst of both worlds. It is a small market, <B>and</B> is occupied by big, powerful competitors."</P>
<P>Both are <STRONG>so</STRONG> true.</P>
