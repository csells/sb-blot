<h1>Another Killer App for Web Services</h1>
<p align="left"><i>Friday, <span class="created">May 21, 
2004</span></i></p><p align="left">At the last <a href="/conference">Applied XML 
Dev.Conf.</a>, I went ga-ga over Amazon's use of web services in their business 
and called it <a href="/12540">the &quot;killer app for web 
services.&quot;</a> Now I'd like to revise my statement: it think that it's one of 
the killer apps for web services.</p><p align="left">Here's another one: 
exposing the functionality of all of those internal corporate services apps that 
are now exposed as web <i>sites</i> as web <i>services</i> instead.</p><p align="left">
Now that I've been back inside of a giant corp. adrift in a sea of sites to 
&quot;help&quot; me with the various &quot;business processes&quot; that I have to execute, I yearn 
for them all to be exposed as web services. There are several problems with the 
internal business-processes-as-web-apps morass that we're stuck in:</p><ol><li><p align="left">
	The web apps are generic for all uses across all companies, which means that 
	there are tons of options for other uses then mine, but I still have to deal 
	with the UI for all of the options</li><li><p align="left">To get my 
	business tasks accomplished, I have to string together several of these web 
	apps in series, manually moving the data from one to the other</li><li><p align="left">
	Just going from one page of a web app to another, even in a corp. intranet, 
	is so slow when you are always going to pick the same options and your 
	fingers want to be far ahead of what the server can handle when generating 
	the UI a page at a time</li></ol><p align="left">For example, here at MSDN, 
we have package source code sent to us by authors into an MSI with a EULA, code 
sign it with the Microsoft key and submit it for download to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/">
the MS download site</a>. A year ago, it took me an hour of instruction to 
understand the process and it involved using VS.NET to build the MSI and two 
separate web sites, both with several pages and tons of fields to get a folder 
of files available for download by our good readers. This took me 30-60 minutes 
to do each time I had to do it, which made me cranky, so I built this:</p><p align="left"><img border="0" src="/public/spout/img.10.jpg" width="480" height="400"></p><p align="left">
This tool takes the minimum number of fields necessary to turn the source files 
provided by the author into a signed MSI. Plus, it's a smart client, so the UI 
is snappy and I can make it smart about what specifically it should remember 
between sessions for our own uses. And, I can provide a single UI for multiple 
back-end services, duplicating the data between them as necessary w/o requiring 
the user to duplicate the data for me.</p><p align="left">The way I was able to 
minimize the number of fields was to build all kinds of assumptions into the app 
based on how MSDN does things, aka the business rules, and build my own app that 
programmatically generates when I need. In other words, my app combines business 
rules with programmatic interfaces to save me and my friends all kinds of time 
(the process is now about 10x faster than it used to be and 100x less tedious 
and less error prone).</p><p align="left">And that's the beauty of allowing 
programmatic access to internal business processes: it allows each group in the 
company to build specific apps that meet their needs more specifically, letting 
them consolidate the processes into their own group-specific tasks. Not only 
does this speed things up and increase consistency for our customers, but it 
also removes the tedium and lowers the possibility of human error. If you could 
gain all those benefits, would you do it? That's the promise of web services and 
SOA when applied internally, because it allows the groups that provide the 
services to be general-purpose, meeting the needs of all groups, but lets each 
group be specific when they apply it, instead of forcing a web interface that 
requires everyone to be general.</p><p align="left">Am I alone in getting 
aroused when thinking about this kind of thing? : )</p><p align="left"><a href="/1354">
