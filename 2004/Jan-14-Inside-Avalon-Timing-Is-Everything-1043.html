<h1>Inside Avalon: Timing Is Everything</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnavalon/html/avalon01062004.asp">Here</a>. Jeff Bogdan, one of the chief architects on the Microsoft Avalon team, kicks off the new Avalon column that he shares with <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com">Chris Anderson</A>, the other chief architect on the Avalon team. These guys know Avalon because they had a hand in inventing it, so I'm *very* much looking forward to this column. Recommended.
