<h1>Looking for WinFS Bloggers</h1>
<A href="/1168">My call for Indigo bloggers</A> was very successful (although most recommendations came via email), providing several interesting Indigo web blog possibilities. On the WinFS side, I only know about Mike Deem, and he seems to have gone into hybernation. Does anyone have anyone else that they'd like to <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Recommended WinFS Blogger">recommend as a WinFS blogger</A>? Thanks!
