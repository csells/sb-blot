<h1>Avalon: From All Code to No Code And In Between</h1>
<P>Today, Joe Marini, a Microsoft PM on a project that dare not speak it's name, posts <A href="http://www.joemarini.com/tutorials/tutorialpages/xamlblogexplorer.php">a blog reader built entirely in XAML</A>, i.e. no .NET code.</P>
<P>Last week, Chris Anderson, an Architect on the Avalon team, showed us <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnavalon/html/avalon03262004.asp">that Avalon requires no XAML at all</A> if you don't want to use it.</P>
<P>However, closer to the truth are Don and ChrisAn, Longhorn architects, on using a mixture of <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20031028LHORNDB/manifest.xml">XAML for declarative UI tasks and code for handling events</A>.</P>
<P>My own preferred model is to do just as much as I can in XAML, because I find declarative style coding more flexible, but to put into code what makes sense, e.g. most event handling. My line in the sand is this: if I would have to embed code in the XAML, I go to real code, otherwise, I use XAML.</P>
