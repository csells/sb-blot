<h1>Talking To Kids About Money</h1>
		<p>I'm a <em>huge</em> fan of talking to kids about money (actually, 
		I'll talk an adult's ears off about money, too, if given half a chance 
		-- I once lectured <a href="http://www.wheaty.net/">Matt 
		Pietrek</a> and his girlfriend on the topic for an hour over pancakes 
		[sorry, guys...]). When I was growing up, the training I got in school 
		about money management has how to write a check, i.e. how to be a good 
		little consumer. I also learned the basics of compound interest, but not 
		as related to anything real, e.g. buying a house or saving for 
		retirement. Most of what I didn't learn in school, I also didn't learn 
		from my parents because one of them (who managed to buy high and sell 
		low during the recent market correction) isn't any good at money 
		management and the other was very private about such things (although 
		has been opening up on this topic recently).</p>
		<p>Me, I go the other way. While they know not to talk about it outside 
		of our immediate family, my kids know how much my wife and I make, how 
		much we spend month to month, how we're saving for their college 
		education, how we're saving for retirement, the investment property I've 
		purchased with my money-savvy brother-in-law (whose parents also refused 
		to talk money with him), etc. The Sells brothers have their own 
		allowance that goes up annually on their hire date aka their birthday. I 
		act as their bank, keeping track of their income and expenses in an 
		Excel spreadsheet as they deposit and withdraw money, limiting them to a 
		single week's &quot;advance&quot; on their allowance (giving them the choice of 
		spending what they've got now vs. saving for what they want in the 
		future). In the future, I plan on letting them maintain their own 
		balance sheet (subject to random audit), like my Mom let me maintain 
		mine on a paper check register (I guess I did learn a little something 
		from my parents -- come to think of it, the way I award allowance is 
		just like my Mom, too -- way to go, Mom! : ).</p>
		<p>Anyway, as open as I am about our money and as much as I bring it up with 
		them in an attempt to stamp the consumer culture out of my children 
		before it takes hold, there are still more things to be done, as I 
		learned this morning on
		<a href="http://www.themint.org/">&quot;the mint,&quot;</a> a web 
		site dedicated to what kids should know about money and how teachers and
		<a href="http://www.themint.org/parents/talktoyourkids.php">
		parents can help</a>. Check it out.</p>
		<p>BTW, I've recently come to the conclusion that a parent paying for 
		their child's college education is a sucker's game, as it drains much 
		needed funds out of the parent's own investments when it should be 
		enjoying the magic of compound interest. Instead, grandparents should 
		pay for college, letting each generation have another 20-30 years of 
		compound interest before skimming off the top for college. The problem 
		with this, of course, is that it requires one generation to pay for both 
		their kids and their grandkids to shift into this new thinking 
		(assuming, of course, that the parents can pay for their kid's college 
		at all, which isn't a given with our current consumer-oriented society). 
		I plan on being that bridge in my family, i.e. I plan to pay for my 
		kids' and my grandkids' college education. I also plan to have myself 
		cryogenically frozen, putting half of my money into a trust for myself 
		when I'm rejuvenated, leaving the other half for my wife. Neither of 
		these has anything to do with this subject, but I thought I'd stick them 
		on the end here anyway. : )</p>
