<h1>Channel9 Ships</h1>
<P>I'm sure by the time you read this, you'll have already heard about <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</A> (apparently <A href="http://www.greghughes.net/rant/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b688caae-8073-4894-8860-172ab849320e">Greg announced it first</A>). There don't seem to be nearly as many <A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/archive/04042004.aspx">snowmen shooting rectangles at each other</A> as I'd expected, though...</P>
