<h1>Randy Jackson on Pleasing the Gods</h1>
<P>Randy Jackson enjoyed <A href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=85">my recent .NET Rocks appearance</A> because of my discussion of how I like to learn things. I only remember talking about two strategies: "ignoring the docs" and "hyperventilating" but his take on it was so beautifully worded, I had to share it with you:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I&#8217;m referring to flying in that strata called by some of my PhD'ed friends as the 'Shirley McLean' possession experience, where the actual act of jumping in to the unknown pleases the Gods in some twisted way and the outcome is usually beyond our expectations."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I don't get the Shirley McLean reference, but I love the bit about pleasing the Gods by jumping into the unknown.</P>
<P>And yes: today I'm going to read you my email because today, clever people insist on emailing me. : P</P>
