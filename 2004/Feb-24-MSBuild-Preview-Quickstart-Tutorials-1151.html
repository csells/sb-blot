<h1>MSBuild Preview Quickstart Tutorials</h1>
Alex Kipman, PM on the MSBuild team, was kind enough to provide <A href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/4/0/d401e5cd-04c7-4b72-b644-a00ae3fd5681/msbuildqs.msi">several tutorials on MSBuild</A>, each of which includes sample projects and documentation. If you're looking to get up to speed on MSBuild, the nextgen .NET build engine, there's no better way. Enjoy!
