<h1>Betting on Longhorn-Only?</h1>
<p><i>Friday, <span class="created">January 30th, 2004</span></i></p><p>In 
response to my post yesterday (<a href="#When_In_Doubt,_Ignore_Longhorn">When In 
Doubt, Ignore Longhorn</a>), Shaun asked whether he should be targeting 
Longhorn-only right now:</p><blockquote><p><i>[ed: the following has been edited 
	to remove identifying remarks at Shaun's request]</i></p><p>Thanks for all 
	the great posts and community participation over the past year. Your recent 
	'Ignore Longhorn' post alarmed me a bit. I hope that was not born from some 
	aspect of it being pushed past 2006.</p><p>Anyway, I know you are busy, so I 
	will get to the point. We are mid-sized, established s/w company, and a 
	Microsoft shop to the core (SQL Server, Analysis Services, VB, we embed VBA 
	etc...). I am facing a huge decision regarding building our next gen app 
	architecture. We need to ship in 1H 2006, and (IMO) we need to target rich 
	and reach, so Longhorn is on my list of possible directions along with some 
	ASP.NET 2.0 / ClickOnce combination. </p><p>I am enjoying working with 
	Longhorn (XAML in particular), but I'm having a hard time shaking the 
	feeling that I am taking too much of a gamble if I go Longhorn-Only, but 
	some of the aspects are just so compelling. On the other hand, I'd hate to 
	make a huge 2-3 year dev investment in ASP.NET only to ship something in 
	2006 that is not revolutionary/differentiated. I firmly believe our existing 
	3 million lines of solid COM code has plenty of life in it too.</p><p>Any 
	insight or advice you might have would be greatly appreciated. I know it is 
	probably difficult without understanding our company or market, but maybe 
	some general advice to someone who is targeting a 2006 release. I guess my 
	other worry surrounds the Longhorn adoption rate, but obviously none of us 
	can predict that!</p></blockquote><p>Here was my answer:</p><blockquote><p>
	Shaun, if you think that Longhorn is going to help you build a 
	differentiated product that'll help you be more successful, then great! 
	That's why we're building it.</p><p>On the other hand, if I were you, I 
	wouldn't put all my money into a single investment. Instead, I'd use some 
	diversification strategies like you would with your financial portfolio. At 
	this point, the ship date of Longhorn, along with the list of features it 
	will support when it ships, is merely speculative. I won't put more than 10% 
	of my available investment time/money/staff into it, leaving the rest of my 
	portfolio for getting the most I can from my existing and/or near future 
	technologies.</p><p>Specifically, you ask about ASP.NET 2.0 and Windows 
	Forms/ClickOnce. Both of those technologies rock. ASP.NET is going to be <i>
	the</i> way to build web sites and services for the next decade at least, 
	even after Longhorn's been out for years, since it has the reach across our 
	existing OSes and competing OSes. Plus, ASP.NET 2.0 has a dizzying list of 
	new features that people will spend years just taking full advantage of. For 
	reach, you can't make a better investment than ASP.NET.</p><p>For rich, on 
	the other hand, Windows Forms + ClickOnce is a killer combo. The updated 
	Windows Forms in Whidbey along provides some amazing new capabilities, not 
	the least of which is the new GridView, which you can read about in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/winforms.asp">
	Michael's new Wonders of Windows Forms piece</a>. Also, look for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/">
	a &quot;What's New in Whidbey Windows Forms&quot; piece in MSDN Magazine</a> RSN. 
	ClickOnce (which you can learn more about in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/pillars/fundamentals/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwinforms/html/clickonce.asp">
	Duncan's ClickOnce piece</a> and in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20040108ClickOnceJC/manifest.xml">
	Jamie's ClickOnce talk</a>) is <i>the</i> way to deploy rich clients in 
	Whidbey <i>and</i> in Longhorn, so digging into that technology is a very 
	good idea.</p><p>As time goes on and Longhorn becomes a more solid 
	development investment, you should put more of your portfolio into it. If 
	you've got plenty of time/money/staff, than 10% now could mean an entire 
	pilot project in Longhorn, which would be a good thing. But if you've got 
	limited amounts of time/money/staff that you really need to yield a dividend 
	now, Longhorn is dangerous for you and should only be something you dabble 
	with at this point.</p><p>For you specifically, a mid-sized company, you 
	should carve off a chunk of your dev. staff to build a pilot in Longhorn. 
	This lets you dabble while the rest of your staff is busy with existing and 
	near future technologies. And as you dabble and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/">
	notice things that don't work at all as you expect or need, let us know</a>! 
	Operators are standing by to take your calls! We're at a stage in our 
	development process where we're able to give <i>much</i> more attention to 
	the fundamentals than we will be at beta, so the 10% you put into Longhorn 
	now could yield large dividends in the future.</p><p>And as to your follow 
	up comment, I'm happy that you enjoyed my response, but I'm pretty sure an 
	autograph from Sting would be cooler. : )</p></blockquote>
