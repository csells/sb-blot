<h1>Mike Harsh On the Life Left in Windows Forms (Lots!)</h1>
<P>Mike Harsh, a PM on the Windows Forms team, gives <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mharsh/archive/2004/09/20/231888.aspx">his opinion on several important Windows Forms and Avalon-related questions</A>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is [Windows Forms 2.0 as the last version of Windows Forms] a bad thing from a developer perspective?</LI>
<LI>So UI library innovation for Windows Forms is finished.&nbsp; Does that make it dead? (no)</LI>
<LI>Is it worth investing in Windows Forms? (yes)</LI>
<LI>Will Windows Forms apps be able to integrate Longhorn controls in under 5 lines of code? (absolutely)</LI>
<LI>If I invest in a large Windows Forms app today will I have to rewrite it in 3 years for Avalon?</LI></UL>
<P>These are Mike's opinions and not official Microsoft messaging, but I'll leave you to decide whether that's worse or better. : )</P>
