<h1>Interview: Longhorn User Experience Gurus, part 2</h1>
<P>Paul Thurrott finishes his 2-part series of <A href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/longhorn_hillel_tjeerd_2.asp">interviews of Hillel Cooperman and Tjeerd Hoek, Longhorn User Experience mavens</A>. The interview covers just how hard it is to make an entire OS usable and just how much work MS does to get it right.</P>
<P>However, one thing that Hillel said struck me particularly as someone fairly new to working at MS:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Actually, that was the shocking thing about coming here: The problems weren't simple. The number of people that I met who were humble, that cared deeply and passionately about making the user experience better for customers and weren't just saying, 'Hey, here's a new API'--not that I don't love a new API--was surprising. These people were really deeply concerned about how they could make customers' lives better and had thought a lot about this, way more than I had. I was blown away. I just couldn't believe it."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That's exactly how I felt coming to MS. We have a PR problem, but we definately do not have a care-about-the-customer problem.</P>
