<h1>Announcing the Longhorn Developer FAQ</h1>
<P>If you've noticed <A href="http://www.ferncrk.com/">Stuart Celarier</A> stalking <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/">the WinFX newsgroups</A> lately, it's because he's been gathering the best stuff for use in <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/support/lhdevfaq/default.aspx">his new Longhorn Developer FAQ</A>.</P>
<P>Plus, Stuart's got all kinds of cool FAQ features, like expanding/contracting items and URLs for each category and for each item. Even cooler, the source document is a WordML document that Stuart authors in Word and then translates into HTML for the MSDN site using an XSLT. It's a very cool model for FAQs in general and I know that Stuart's planning to share the FAQ framework on <A href="http://www.ferncrk.com/">his site</A>.</P>
<P>And, if you've got an feedback on the FAQ items or would like to see new ones (or would like to hire him -- he's amazing with all things XML), <A href="mailto:stuart@ferncrk.com">feel free to send him an email</A>.</P>
