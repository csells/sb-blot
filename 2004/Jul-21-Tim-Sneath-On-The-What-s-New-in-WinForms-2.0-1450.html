<h1>Tim Sneath On The What's New in WinForms 2.0</h1>
Tim Sneath has <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2004/07/20/188775.aspx">a nice, concise list of what's new in Windows Forms 2.0</A>. By far and away, ClickOnce deployment as an order of magnitude improvement over No-Touch Deployment is my favorite advance, but the new controls are cool (you can drop the standard buttons on the menu and toolstrips from the context menu), the BackgroundWorker is very cool (and eliminates about 2/3rds of the code in my threading chapter) and the designer layout assistance for helping with the layout and spacing of controls sounds like it'll reduce a bunch of monkey work in the designer.
