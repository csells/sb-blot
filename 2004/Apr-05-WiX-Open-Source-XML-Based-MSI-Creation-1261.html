<h1>WiX: Open Source XML-Based MSI Creation</h1>
<P>Rob Mensching, an MS SDE, has finally released his <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/04/05/107709.aspx">WiX tools for building MSI files from XML</A>. I say "finally," because I've been using his tools for months to build the MSI files that MSDN puts up on microsoft.com/download. All of our downloads have to be wrapped in an MSI so that you have to agree to the EULA before you get the files. Plus, we need to bundle some descriptive text and author name in there, along with the code that pops open the install folder after the files have been installed. Instead of using VS.NET to create the MSI files for each set of folks, I built a tool and the best programatic interface to creating MSI files that I could find was easily Rob's. <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2004/04/05/107709.aspx">Check it out.</A></P>
