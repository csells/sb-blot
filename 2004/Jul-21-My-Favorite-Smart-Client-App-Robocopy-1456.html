<h1>My Favorite Smart Client App: Robocopy</h1>
<P>There's a smart client app that I've found myself using more and more and loving it: robocopy. The UI for robocopy sucks, of course. It's a command line app with a myriad of options that take experimentation to really figure out, but once it's started, it works like a champ, providing progress on each file and, most importantly, retrying once it loses it's network connection.</P>
<P>What this allows me to do is set up long copy operations bringing down the latest internal Longhorn builds (which are huge) over my uncertain VPN connection. When I hibernate my box, I don't worry about Robocopy dropping bits or getting confused and when I lose my internet or VPN connection, it retires 1 *million* times before giving up, which gives me plenty of time to notice and reestablish the connection.</P>
<P>Slap a friendlier UI on Robocopy and you've got a wonderful smart client citizen that should be emulated.</P>
