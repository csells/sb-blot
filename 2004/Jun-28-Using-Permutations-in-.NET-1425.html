<h1>Using Permutations in .NET</h1>
<P>I know this is almost a year old, but the permutations algorithm was my favorite from STL and I've had occassion to miss it since moving to .NET, so it was nice to find Dr. James McCaffrey's <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/permutations.asp">Using Permutations in .NET for Improved Systems Security</A> on msdn.com. The security implications are interesting, I suppose, but permutations are useful than that (like if you're <a href="/12488">trying to crush librarians</A>...).</P>
