<h1>Inside Some MS Product Team Processes</h1>
<P>It was very cool to see into some of the internal MS product team processes:</P>

<li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2004/10/28/249458.aspx">Testing ASP.NET 2.0 and Visual Web Developer </a></li>

<LI><A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=26641">A real, live bug triage meeting</A></LI></UL>
<P>This stuff is very cool because even internally, if you're not on a product team or if you're on a different product team, it's useful to see what other product teams do.</P>
<P>This just makes you want to drop everything and sign up for a product team, doesn't it? <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/careers/default.mspx">MS is hiring...</A></P>
