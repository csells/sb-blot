<h1>Tim Ewald On MSDN2 Internals</h1>
<P>Tim Ewald, the architect of <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/">the MSDN2 web site (still in alpha)</A> <A href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2004/09/23/2368.aspx">talks about how and why it was built and points out some undocumented features</A>, particularly in the new URL by alias scheme.</P>
<P>Plus, I don't know if it's not experiencing the load of the old site yet or that it's not built from HxS files, but <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/">MSDN2 <EM>smokes</EM> perf-wise</A>. Highly recommended.</P>
<P>Also, if you want to know Tim's thoughts on building giant, scalable web sites based on XML and web services (both input internally and hopefully output externally someday), check out <A HREF="/public/conference/">his keynote at the Applied XML Developer's Conference, October 20-21</A>. We've already sold out once and had to request more space, so <A href="https://www.pluralsight.com/events/devcon/secure/register.aspx">register quickly</A>.</P>
<p>BTW, since <a href="http://www.pluralsite.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2004/09/23/2371.aspx">Tim no longer works at Microsoft</a> (bad for us), you should get a lot more candid view on what he really thinks in his keynote (good for you). I, for one, can't wait. : )</p>
