<h1>Timeshifting Rocks</h1>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/26/1420209">Here</a>. <P>My ReplayTV has made me such a bigot that I can't even watch normal TV w/o turning up my nose in disgust anymore. Also, I love download into MS lectures and playing them back at 1.5 speed while I'm on my treadmill; exercising my mind and my body at the same time. All media should be timeshifted. *All* *media*.</P>
