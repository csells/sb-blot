<h1>MSDNers Storming the 5/18 Portland Nerd Dinner</h1>
<P>An undisclosed number of MSDNers are going to be attending <A href="http://snowstormlife.com/blogs/bliz/PermaLink.aspx?guid=0fde8aa6-b19e-4b2d-ad6a-2a2586360aff">Jim's Portland Nerd Dinner on May 18th</A>. If you've got an ask of MSDN or content to pitch or just want to hang with folks that really know their stuff, you should show up.</P>
<P>Plus, my boss has one of those nifty MS American Express cards, so we should be able to overpower him and use it to pay for our crappy food court dinners. And as if that weren't enough, my boss will also be packing some MS "crap" (his words : ), so if you only come to one PND, make it this one!</P>
