<h1>Distributed Shared Always On Message Queue Service</h1>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_7/104-8999252-2227109?%5Fencoding=UTF8&node=13584001&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Here</a>. Jeff Barr of Amazon has just informed me that <A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_7/104-8999252-2227109?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;node=13584001&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Amazon now provides a distributed, shared, always on message queuing service</A> which allows you to create and delete queues, enqueue, read and dequeue messages that can stay put for as long as 30 days. It's free right now and I don't quite know how it will be used for porn and spam, but I have every confidence that you guys will figure it out. : )
