<h1>PInvoke.NET: Interop the Wiki Way</h1>
<a href="http://www.pinvoke.net/">Here</a>. Whoever put this site together had the right idea. I was hoping to work my magic to get MS to publish a giant interop DB, but instead of waiting, Adam Nathan (of <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/067232170X/chrissells">.NET and COM: The Complete Interoperability Guide</A>&nbsp;fame) put up a wiki to collect all of the P/Invoke signatures that the community already knows about. Yeah, baby! This could finally be a wiki I can get behind! (Sorry, <A href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward</A>, but I've just never found a wiki that makes me want to hang out there...)
