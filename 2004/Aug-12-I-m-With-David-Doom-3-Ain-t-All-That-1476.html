<h1>I'm With David: Doom 3 Ain't All That</h1>
I can't tell you how much I loved Doom. I've probably played all of the Doom games back-to-back all the way through a half a dozen times over the last decade. And I was <EM>so</EM> excited about Doom 3, but <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dweller/archive/2004/08/12/213299.aspx">David's right</A>: Star Wars is to Phantom Menace as Doom 1 is to Doom 3: much prettier but much less fun.
