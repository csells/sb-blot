<h1>Jeremy Mazern on What Happened To Longhorn & WinFS</h1>
Jeremy contributes to the news about <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/archive/2004/08/29/222488.aspx">Longhorn</A> and <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/archive/2004/08/29/222493.aspx">WinFS</A>. Most interesting is Jeremy's discussion of the usability&nbsp;studies we did on WinFS and how we're using that information to improve the API. Check it out.
