<h1>.NET Show: Don and Doug on Connected Systems</h1>
<P>I'm downloading this now, but anytime I get a chance to see Don Box or Doug Purdy speak, I want to do it. To <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/episode046/default.asp">see them both together</A>?!? Oh la la!</P>
<P>And after watching them together on the latest .NET Show, I get to <a href="/public/conference/">see them again next week at the Applied XML Developer's Conference</A>. How lucky am I? : )</P>
