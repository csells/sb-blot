<h1>Bush: Get Your Own Dream!</h1>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,61915,00.html">Here</a>. <P>It bugs me that Bush would steal JFK's dream of getting off of our planet, especially after we've already done it. Why not reach for getting America off of foreign oil by developing alternative energy sources, freeing us from the need to screw around with other countries and making us targets for terrorism? That's a cool dream. But noooo, you can't do that one, because you're just a shill for US big oil!</P>
<P>Sorry about that... I now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.</P>
