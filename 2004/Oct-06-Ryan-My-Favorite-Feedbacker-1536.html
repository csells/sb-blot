<h1>Ryan, My Favorite Feedbacker</h1>
<P>If I'm doing the calculations correctly, Ryan Dawson is not yet old enough to drink, but he still manages to give the best, most direct, most thorough feedback of anyone in the WinFX/Longhorn developer community (<A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">Ian Griffiths</A> is a close second, but he's got that English polite thing going for him, so it's hard to know just&nbsp;how much he's really complaining&nbsp;: ). Ryan's built apps to test the various pillars and makes his complaints very clear, as in <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rdawson/archive/2004/10/05/5841.aspx">this post about Avalon 3D</A>.</P>
<P>That's not to say that I agree with everything he says or that the product team agrees, but I wish I had 100 more Ryan Dawson's banging on the pillars and complaining loudly and clearly so that the product teams can get some crystal clear feedback on what works, what doesn't and what developers want. If you don't have a blog, get one or post your complaints on <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/">the newsgroups</A>. Come on! Tell us why we suck and what to do to stop sucking! You know you want to. : )</P>
