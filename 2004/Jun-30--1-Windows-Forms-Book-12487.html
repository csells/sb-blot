<h1>#1 Windows Forms Book</h1>
<p align="left"><i>Wednesday, <span class="created">June 30th, 2004</span></i></p><p align="left">
I just got word from my publisher that, according to the industry-wide metrics 
they use, <a href="/public/writing/wfbook">Windows Forms Programming in C#</a> is the 
#1 seller in it's category week-to-week by a wide margin over everyone but 
Petzold (who I'm still beating, but by a smaller margin). And while Petzold has 
sold more copies overall, he had a 2-year head start on me and I'm gaining. 
Further, earlier today, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/new-for-you/top-sellers/-/books/5/books/2/ref=pd_hn_ts_b/">
Amazon.com had the book listed as the #5 best selling computer book</a> 
(although it's at #10 right now with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321116208/ref=pd_ts_b_10/chrissells/">
a sales rank of 459 and a ranking of 5 out of 5 with 52 reviews</a>).</p><p align="left">
I normally try to toot my own horn a little more subtly than this, but the idea 
that I could learn Windows programming from the best-selling Windows book author 
of all time and then, 10 years later, beat his sales numbers makes me damn 
proud. Thanks to all the reviewers and folks that gave me feedback on the 
materials in my articles, to Shawn Wildermuth and Mike Weinhardt, who actually 
contributed material to the book and to Addison-Wesley for printing it (and then 
re-printing it, and then re-printing it... : ).</p><p align="left"><a href="/1429">
