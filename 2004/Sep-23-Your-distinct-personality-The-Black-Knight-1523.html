<h1>Your distinct personality: The Black Knight</h1>
<P><IMG src="http://www.cmi-lmi.com/images/bknight.gif" align=left></IMG>According to <A href="http://www.cmi-lmi.com/kingdom.html">this survey</A>, my personality type is The Black Knight: "Your distinct personality, The Black Knight, might be found in most of the thriving kingdoms of the time. Your overriding goal is to win. You approach each task or situation as a contest to be won strategically and efficiently. Because you can control your feelings, it is not unusual for you to charm, as well as successfully delegate tasks and responsibilities to the more emotional types. You are often concerned with what's in it for you. You seldom involve yourself in activities where you can not foresee a reward for your investment or effort. On the positive side, you can be analytically empathic and logically persuasive. On the negative side, you may be unemotionally manipulative as well as impulsive. Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms."</P>
<P>The title is certainly cooler than "Scullery Maid," but the text makes me sound like kind of an asshole... (not that I'm arguing, mind you, I'm just surprised that a computer program can pick it up so readily : )</P>
