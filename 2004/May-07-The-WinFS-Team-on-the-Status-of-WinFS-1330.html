<h1>The WinFS Team on the Status of WinFS</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.developer.winfx.winfs&mid=600906c5-1d85-4309-84b8-42e28fa29635">Here</a>. <P>After <A href="http://yahoo.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_16/b3879009_mz001.htm">Business Week reported the death of WinFS</A>, some folks have been justifiably worried that such a cool feature would, in fact, be missing when their copy of Longhorn showed up at their door. Today <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.developer.winfx.winfs&amp;mid=600906c5-1d85-4309-84b8-42e28fa29635">Toby Whitney, the Group Program Manager of the WinFS team, stepped in to report that WinFS was alive and well</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"WinFS is in good shape and hasn't been cut from Longhorn.&nbsp; We're going to ship it :-).&nbsp; What we need is your feedback on whether we're building the right thing.&nbsp; It'd be great if you went to MSDN and downloaded the newest bits.&nbsp; They're much more stable and represent a big evolution of what we're doing."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To provide the feedback that Toby is looking for, <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/downloads/default.aspx">download Longhorn and the Longhorn SDK from the MSDN Subscriber Downloads section</A> and <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.developer.winfx.winfs">post your feedback on the WinFS newsgroup</A>, where Toby posted his response and the WinFS team is hangs out waiting for you.</P>
