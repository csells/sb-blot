<h1>Here's A Side Of The Olympic I Hadn't Heard Before</h1>
<P>"At the Albertville winter Olympics, condom machines in the athletes' village had to be refilled every two hours. And in Sydney the organisers' original order of 70,000 condoms went so fast that they had to order 20,000 more. Even with the replenishment, the supply was exhausted three days before the end of the competition schedule. (For the record, athletes who were in Sydney report that the Cuban delegation was the first to use up its allocation.) Salt Lake City in 2002 went even bigger: 250,000 condoms were handed out, despite the objections of the city's Mormon leadership."</P>
<P>"<A href="http://news.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=814602004">There's a lot of sex going on.</A> You get a lot of people who are in shape, and, you know, testosterone's up and everybody's attracted to everybody," says Breaux Greer, a shaggy-blond Californian who competed in the javelin at the Sydney Games."</P>
<P>It sounds like a PDC, except that we don't have anyone in shape, anyone attractive or any the sex... (or maybe I'm just going to the wrong parties : ).</P>
