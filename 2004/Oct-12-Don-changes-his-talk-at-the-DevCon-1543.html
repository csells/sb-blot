<h1>Don changes his talk at the DevCon</h1>
<a href="/public/conference/#ws-islands">Here</a>. <P>Don got a last minute bug to write on <A HREF="/public/conference/#ws-islands">a completely different topic</A>. I just got the slides this morning and they're different than anything I've ever seen from Don (which is saying a lot). The new title of the talk is "ws-islands" and while I have no abstract as yet, I'm still very much looking forward to the talk for the psychedelic effects of the slides alone (I asked him to be careful not to cause seizures in the audience).</P>
<P>There are just a few seats left, so <A href="https://www.pluralsight.com/events/devcon/secure/register.aspx">register now</A> or be prepared to sit this one out.</P>
