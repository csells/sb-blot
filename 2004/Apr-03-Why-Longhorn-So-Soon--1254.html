<h1>Why Longhorn So Soon?</h1>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/theshow/archive/2004/04/02/106614.aspx">Here</a>. <P>Robert Hess, that .NET Show guy, talks about why he's so into Longhorn in the recent .NET Shows lately:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"What you -do- need to pay attention to, is how 'Longhorn' will evolve the users concept of exactly what a Windows application is all about, and what features and functionality it should be providing them with. Many application developers should be starting to think about this TODAY, and how to begin incorporating some of these features into their application moving forward. Just the schematized file system that WinFS will introduce alone can represent not only a big jump in the potential functionality of an application, but also a considerable change in how your existing application might want to begin thinking about data storage."</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
