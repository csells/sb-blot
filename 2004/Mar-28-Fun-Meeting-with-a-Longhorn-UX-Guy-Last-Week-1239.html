<h1>Fun Meeting with a Longhorn UX Guy Last Week</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/ux/">Here</a>. <P>He said, "Do you think we should support RSS in Longhorn?"</P>
<P>I said, "Well, there's that RSS Tile..."</P>
<P>He said, "Yeah, but shouldn't we do more?"</P>
<P>I said, "Well, sure, what we should really do is blah, but we'd also need foo to make that work."</P>
<P>He said, "Right. What if we did quuz to enable foo?"</P>
<P>I said, "Wow. That'd be cool. Can you actually make that happen?"</P>
<P>He said, "Yep."</P>
<P>Whoa.</P>
