<h1>A Redundant Chris Sells</h1>
<P>When I'm having fun with the Sells brothers, I like to tell them that I don't have two boys, but rather one boy and one redundant backup in case one of them needs "erasing." I have never told which of them is which, however, 'cuz I like to tortune them (hey! I paid for 'em!)</P>
<P>I would if <A HREF="">Chris J. Sells in Beaverton, OR</A> or <A href="http://www.chrissells.com">Chris D. Sells in Dallas, TX</A> is the redundant one...</P>
