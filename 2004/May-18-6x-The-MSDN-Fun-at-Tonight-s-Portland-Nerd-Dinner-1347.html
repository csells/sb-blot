<h1>6x The MSDN Fun at Tonight's Portland Nerd Dinner</h1>
I just talked to the 2 cars filled with 5 members of the MSDN Content Strategy team on a road trip down to the <A href="http://snowstormlife.com/blogs/bliz/PermaLink.aspx?guid=0fde8aa6-b19e-4b2d-ad6a-2a2586360aff">Portland Nerd Dinner</A>, tonight (5/18/04) at 6:30pm in the Washington Square Mall food court. Also, make sure not to buy your dinner 'til the MSDNers are here with their corp. credit cards and can pay for your crappy mall food. : )
