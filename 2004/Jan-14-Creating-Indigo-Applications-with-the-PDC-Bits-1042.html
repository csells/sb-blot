<h1>Creating Indigo Applications with the PDC Bits</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlingo/html/indigolingo01062004.asp">Here</a>. Yasser Shohoud, a member of the Indigo team at Microsoft,&nbsp;kicks off his new Indigo column with a walk-through of how to get started programming Indigo using the Visual Studio .NET templates that come with the Longhorn SDK. Yasser is also the author of the well-regarded <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201774259">Real World XML Web Services: For VB and VB .NET Developers</A>, so I'm looking forward to more discussions of how to apply Indigo in the real world. Recommended.
