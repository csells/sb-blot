<h1>Adding Meaning To Your Work</h1>
And while we're on companies formed by ex-DevelopMentorites, check out <A href="http://www.relevancellc.com/">Relevance, LLC, a software contracting and content creation firm</A> founded by <A href="http://www.relevancellc.com/halloway.htm">Stuart Halloway</A> and <A href="http://www.relevancellc.com/gehtland.htm">Justin Geghtland</A>, the former DevelopMentor CTO and Head of IT, respectively. Justin was the co-author of <A HREF="/public/writing/wfbook">the VB.NET version of Windows Forms book</A> and Stuart did some very cool Gen&lt;X&gt; work, so I'm big fans of both of them. Relevance has been around for a while and are already doing all kinds of interesting projects, but if you can get them for your interesting project, you won't be sorry.
