<h1>MS Blogging About Longhorn 14% of the Time</h1>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dweller/archive/2004/01/30/65351.aspx">Here</a>. Just following up again on <a href="/12508">When In Doubt, Ignore Longhorn</A> to point out an interesting survey of MS bloggers by David Weller. Apparently, out of 56 recent blog entries by Microsoft&nbsp;employees, 8 were related to Longhorn. That's about 14%, which is a little higher than the 10% that I argued for, but I bet if you took out the ones from me (whose job it is to talk about Longhorn), we'd be closer. : )
