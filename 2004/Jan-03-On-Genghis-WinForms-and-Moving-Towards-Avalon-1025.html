<h1>On Genghis, WinForms and Moving Towards Avalon</h1>
<a href="/12510">Here</a>. Inspired by <A href="/1016">my pending interview of Don Box</FONT></A>, Paolo Severini sent along an interview for me on Genghis, WinForms and how to move towards Avalon (although not in that order). The questions were so good, I thought I'd share them. Thanks, Paola!
