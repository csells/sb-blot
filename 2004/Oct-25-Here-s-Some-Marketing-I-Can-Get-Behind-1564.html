<h1>Here's Some Marketing I Can Get Behind</h1>
I just got an email <A href="http://www.netflix.com/FAQ?p_faqid=522">from Netflix letting me know that they're lowering my monthly fee from $22 to $18</A>. The only thing vaguely "marketing" about is that they used $21.99 and $17.99. There was no upsell. There was no limitation of service at that new lower price. There nothing additional I had to do to get the savings. When's the last time you got that kind of service from a vendor? <A href="http://www.netflix.com/">I love Netflix</A>.
