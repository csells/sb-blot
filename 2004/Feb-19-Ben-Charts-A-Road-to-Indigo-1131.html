<h1>Ben Charts A Road to Indigo</h1>
If you haven't gotten the Indigo bug yet, <A href="http://benjaminm.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=27c7ec47-a47e-492e-b8a0-f8191c115bd5">Benjamin Mitchell lays out a nice, easily digestible Indigo intro</A> on what all the fuss is about. I especially like the picture showing all communications roads leading to Indigo while maintaining the advantages of multiple styles of programming. Looking forward to reading more, Mr. Mitchell.
