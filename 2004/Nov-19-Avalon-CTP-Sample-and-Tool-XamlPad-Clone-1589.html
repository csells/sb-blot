<h1>Avalon CTP Sample and Tool: XamlPad Clone</h1>
Chris Anderson cloned an internal <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/6a8e0cf6-b211-4cb0-9a67-1fe42cdef146">app for the Avalon CTP called "XamlPad"</A> and posted it on his site. Enjoy.
<p />
This just in: <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/permalink.aspx/5ee9126c-1ecd-48c4-ab2a-97e1f9cc61ed">Chris has posted a version of his XamlPad Clone on a server via ClickOnce</a> so <a href="http://blog.simplegeek.com/avalon/xp.deploy">you can just run it directly</a> (and it works, too! Wahoo!).
<p />
Plus, <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/11/20/avalononxp">Ian's posted a hack to the sample that Chris's XamlPad Clone comes with</a>. Fun. : )
