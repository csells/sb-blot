Not only does <a href="/12514">Longhorn intimidate me</A> by removing my safe, comfortable barriers to building difficult applications, <A href="http://www.stereolize.com">Stereolize</A> <A href="http://www.stereolize.com/Clients/Ventuz/Movies/VentuzTrailer_complete.wmv">does the same for presentations</A>, but seems to require a music composer as well as a graphic designer. Yikes!
