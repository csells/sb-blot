<h1>Carl Franklin interviewed by ChrisS and RoryB</h1>
<P>A month or so back, Carl and I were hanging out and it occured to me that while Carl had been interviewing famous folks all over the place on his .NET Rocks Show, he hadn't been interviewed himself. So, Rory and I turned the tables on him. What results in <A href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=50">Carl rambling on in pure bliss for almost two hours</A>. Enjoy. : )</P>
