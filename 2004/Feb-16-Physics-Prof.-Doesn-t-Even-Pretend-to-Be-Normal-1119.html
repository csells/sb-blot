<h1>Physics Prof. Doesn't Even Pretend to Be Normal</h1>
<P>There are two kinds of geeks:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Geeks that try to hide it</LI>
<LI>Geeks that embrace it</LI></OL>
<P>Since it became obvious very early to me that geeks of the #2 sort find it nearly impossible to get girls, I learned in college to hide my geekness in mixed company (mostly : ). For example, I absolutely have to have a cell phone small enough for my front pocket because the Batman utility belt look just doesn't say "breed with me."</P>
<P>On the other hand, geeks of the #2 sort are the ones that keep a Star Trek convention going every weekend of the year somewhere on the planet, fill comic book conventions and, apparently, <A href="http://scienceblog.com/community/article2312.html">teach physics based on why Krypton just *had* to explode</A>. You gotta respect someone that's willing to embrace their true inner self to the point of risking their ability to even practice contributing to the genepool...</P>
