<h1>New IE Security Features in XPSP2</h1>
<P>Tony Screiner is spending <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tonyschr/">the next week or so covering the new security features that XPSP2 includes for IE</A>, starting today with <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tonyschr/archive/2004/03/21/93430.aspx">the new Authenticode dialog</A> (which is very reminiscent of what's coming in Whidbey's ClickOnce and in Longhorn). <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tonyschr/Rss.aspx">Subscribed.</A></P>
