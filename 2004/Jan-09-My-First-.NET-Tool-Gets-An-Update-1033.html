<h1>My First .NET Tool Gets An Update</h1>
<a href="/12432">Here</a>. <P>Given <A href="http://staff.develop.com/aarons/xmllinks.htm#samples-dotnet">Aaron's wonderful set of .NET XML tools</A>, I don't know why Tony Malandain found my little xmlValid tool for checking XML well-formedness and schema validness, but he did and then added the ability to take XML input from stdin (he apparently uses it to check compressed SVG files).</P>
<P>What makes this kind of unusual is that I built this tool almost 2.5 years ago. In fact, it was the first .NET tool I posted on my site. Before that, it was all C++ and COM, although almost none of that has gone up since. It was kind of fun digging into that code again. I spent a bunch of time rearranging it to map more closely to my current .NET coding style not because it added any more functionality but because I couldn't stand not to. This developer thing is just a sickness, isn't it? : )</P>
