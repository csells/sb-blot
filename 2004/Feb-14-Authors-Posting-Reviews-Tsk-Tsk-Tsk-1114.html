<h1>Authors Posting Reviews: Tsk, Tsk, Tsk</h1>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/14/technology/14AMAZ.html?ex=1392094800&en=183dc1d16a0c7b4c&ei=5007">Here</a>. <P>As I've always suspected, <A href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/14/technology/14AMAZ.html?ex=1392094800&amp;en=183dc1d16a0c7b4c&amp;ei=5007">authors are posting their own reviews on Amazon</A>. It's that anon thing -- gets you ever time. Of course, they justify their actions because anonymous folks get to say bad things about their books and they need to defend themselves (the other side of the anon coin).</P>
<P>For the record (although how can you really trust a statement like this?), I never post reviews on my own books and I always put my name on any review or feedback I give of any kind. I do shamelessly ask for reviews when I get emails about my book, but at least I'm open about it. : )</P>
