<h1>RobertM On Consuming XAML From A Web Server</h1>
<P>Robert McLaws makes <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/robert/archive/2004/06/18/3731.aspx">an interesting observation about the possibility of consuming XAML from a web server</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"So, if Microsoft wants to blur the lines between a web site and an client-side application, what makes you think that the next version of IIS will not support serving up XAML to the client. Instead of getting a limited browser experience at http://www.longhornblogs.com/default.aspx, what if you could get a super-interactive experience with the full power of the client at http://www.longhornblogs.com/<STRONG>default.xaml</STRONG>? What if, on a mobile device, you could use web services to allow location-aware applications ultra-dynamic, serving up XAML UI code along with data? A thick thin-client? Talk about a contradiction in terms. The possibilities become greatly expanded if you beging looking at what's in front of you instead of looking behind your shoulder at what's behind you."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The future is unwritten.</P>
