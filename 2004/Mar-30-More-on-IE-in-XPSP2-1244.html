<h1>More on IE in XPSP2</h1>
<P>Tony Schreiner has&nbsp;2 more pieces on changes in IE in XPSP2 bringing the total to 3:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tonyschr/archive/2004/03/21/93430.aspx">Authenticode - No and never again!</A></LI>
<LI><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tonyschr/archive/2004/03/21/93551.aspx">Information Bar - Stopping the modal dialog madness</A></LI>

<P>I especially appreciate the Information Bar, which I'd describe as a status bar at the top of the window. I hate modal dialogs, so not stopping what I'm doing to inform me of something is nice. Plus, studies show that nobody ever looks at the bottom of the screen for info, so putting the InfoBar at the top makes a lot more sense.</P>
<P>Also, I've got XPSP2 RC1 on one of my machines that was plagued with pop-ups and web crap of all kinds. Now, all of that is gone and I've got a lot more info about things that sites were doing that no longer works, but I didn't want them doing that stuff anyway.</P>
