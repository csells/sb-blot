<h1>The Future Is eBay for Services</h1>
<a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/default.asp">Here</a>. <P>With the bottom line more and more important, the era of "company loyalty" and "guaranteed employment" is long over. RentACoder.com takes this to it's logical conclusion, matching vendors with jobs and money with qualified folks with the time and willingness to do the job at the asking price. As connectedness improves, the importance of being on site declines, the perfect market for services will develop, giving us eBay for employment.</P>
