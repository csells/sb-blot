<h1>WinFS Scenario #2: Event Planning </h1>
<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/archive/2004/02/19/76828.aspx">Jeremy Mazner presents his second scenario for WinFS</A>, this time describing his idea app for event management that would be cake to implement using WinFS. In fact, I'm pretty sure you could do the whole thing in the shell.</P>
<P>On a related note, I was watching an internal training video on WinFS yesterday and it excited me in a way that's not appropriate for humans to feel about technology. The enumeration, update, serialization, relationship, extensibility and notification models just all seem so *right*. I'm looking forward to another drop of the bits that enables me to extend WinFS so I can really start building stuff.</P>
