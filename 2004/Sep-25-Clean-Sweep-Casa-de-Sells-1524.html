<P>Today at Casa de Sells we completed a 9-month long whole-house <A href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/cleansweep/cleansweep.html">Clean Sweep</A>, literally touching everything we own and deciding whether to keep it, sell it or trash it. We didn't actually remodel anything while our stuff was on the lawn, but the whole place seems much bigger since emptying the things we no longer used out of the house and completely filling a&nbsp;2-car garage before hauling the stuff off to <A href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/cleansweep/cleansweep.html">Powell's book store</A> (they buy as well as sell) and conducting not one but two giant garage sales in two separate neighborhoods. The $5671 we earned along the way was just found money (especially Melissa's paycheck... : ).</P>
