<h1>How Anon Delegates Are Implemented in Whidbey</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/02/16/anondelegates">IanG posts a nice treatment of how anonymous delegates are actually implemented in C# Whidbey</A>, which has interesting consequences on what you can do with them. Bottom line: they work how you'd want them to.</P>
<P>On a side note, I've loving this blog thing. I used to have to wade through tons of noise on mailing lists and newsgroup or meet up with my DevelopMentor colleagues at some conference to get this kind of nugget. Now, because blog software is so cheap and easy and my friends are hopelessly wordy, I can listen to the signal only and spend the rest of the day with my family.</P>
