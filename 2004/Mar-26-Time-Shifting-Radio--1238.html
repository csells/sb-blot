<h1>Time-Shifting Radio?</h1>
I was reading <A href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/PermaLink.aspx/4bc19137-0150-46f6-90e7-cd3808ff6fe2">Paul Vick</A>, who agrees with <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cfranklin/archive/2004/03/25/95783.aspx">Carl Franklin</A> that the "This American Life" weekly NPR radio program rocks (I'm paraphrasing : ). In addition, I really like Garrison Keillor, "Whad'Ya Know?" and&nbsp;a bunch of the financial programs on AM radio. However, unlike <A href="http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/replaytv/default.asp">my time-shifting TV appliance</A>, I don't have any good way to time-shift radio (the AM stuff is rife with commercials, so <EM>really</EM> needs a fast-forward feature). Anyone got something for me? Ideally, I'd be able to dump programs to an MP3 player for convenient playback.
