<h1>Avalon Data Binding Talk, PADNUG, Thurs, 6/24/04</h1>
<P><SPAN>"If you're familiar with data binding in Windows Forms or ASP.NET, you ain't seen nothin' yet. In <A href="http://www.padnug.org/padnug/meetings.aspx?ID=90">this presentation</A>, Chris Sells, Content Strategist for the <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/">MSDN Longhorn Developer Center</A> Web site, will cover data binding in Avalon, the new UI stack in Longhorn, Microsoft's next OS. Chris will cover the basics of data binding and then move into transformers, filters and styling. If you're going to build UIs in Avalon, you'd be crazy not to use data binding to do it."</SPAN></P>
