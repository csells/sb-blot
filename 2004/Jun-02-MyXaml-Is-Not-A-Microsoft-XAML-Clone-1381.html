<h1>MyXaml Is Not A Microsoft XAML Clone</h1>
<P>Just to be clear, Marc Clifton's MyXaml framework for adding a declarative UI mark-up language to today's .NET framework is <STRONG><EM>not</EM></STRONG> a clone/sub-set of Microsoft's XAML or Avalon targeted at Longhorn. In other words, while MyXaml provides a number of the benefits of declarative UI mark-up for building smart/rich clients today, <A href="http://myxaml.com/marcclifton/archive/2004/06/01/309.aspx">MyXaml is <EM><STRONG>not</STRONG></EM> a way to write WinForms code today that will seamlessly turn into Avalon code tomorrow</A>.</P>
<P>The reason I mention this is because I've seen some folks get a bit confused by the use of "Xaml" in the name (Marc is using XAML as the generic Extensible Application Mark-up Language and not as related to Microsoft's XAML).</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are two other projects that <EM><STRONG>are</STRONG></EM> aiming to clone/sub-set XAML/Avalon on .NET today: <A href="http://www.xamlon.com/">Xamlon</A> and <A href="http://www.mobiform.com/xamlproducts.aspx">Mobiform's XAML products</A>. I can't claim that either of these will actually help you transition to Longhorn when it comes along, but I know that <A href="http://xamlblogs.com/paul/archive/2004/06/01/175.aspx">Xamlon's XAML samples work with minor tweaks on their parser and on the WinHEC build of Longhorn</A>.</P>
