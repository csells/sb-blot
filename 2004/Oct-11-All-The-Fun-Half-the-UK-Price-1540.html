<h1>All The Fun, Half the UK Price</h1>
Curt Johnson, my marketing guy at Addison-Wesley, has let me know this morning at <A href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321116208/chrissells">the UK Amazon is having a 1/2 price sale on my Windows Forms book</A> this month. Plus, the UK guys have their own reviews that are just as nice as the US reviews. Who knew? : )
