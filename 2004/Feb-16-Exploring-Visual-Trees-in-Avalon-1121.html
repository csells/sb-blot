<h1>Exploring Visual Trees in Avalon</h1>
Kenny Lim posted an article about <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/digitalnetbizz/archive/2004/02/16/73603.aspx">Visual Trees in Avalon</A> that was down right inspirational. In fact, I spent all morning building a little app that will dump the &lt;VisualTree&gt; portion of a &lt;Style&gt; so that when you're customizing the visual tree of an existing control, you have some place from which to start. As soon as I figure out how to get property aliasing and data binding info at run-time, I'll post my app for real but <A HREF="/public/tools/visualTreeShower.zip">the current version is available here</A> for the adventurous.
