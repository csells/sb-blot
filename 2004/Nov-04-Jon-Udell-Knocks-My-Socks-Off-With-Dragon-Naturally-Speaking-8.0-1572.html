<h1>Jon Udell Knocks My Socks Off With Dragon Naturally Speaking 8.0</h1>
I've never really seen anyone use speech recognition for real and after <A href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/04.html#a1108">watching Jon Udell use Dragon Naturally Speaking 8.0</A>, I'm flabbergasted. I had no idea working with it could be so natural. Wow.
