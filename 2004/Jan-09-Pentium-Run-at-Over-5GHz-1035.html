<h1>Pentium Run at Over 5GHz</h1>
<a href="http://www12.tomshardware.com/images/thg_video_11_5ghz.zip">Here</a>. <P>Tom's Hardware is hosting a video of a guy moving heaven, earth and liquid nitrogen to get his PC over 5GHz. I don't know the right term, but the arrangement of the shots and the music made me laugh all the way through. And the ending is worth sticking around for. : )</P>
<P>BTW, I'm sure I overhyped this so you won't enjoy it like I did, but that's OK; I'm posting this with a smile. : )</P>
