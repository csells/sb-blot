<h1>A Kinder, Gentler Driver Model for Longhorn</h1>
<P>According to legend, half the Windows XP BSODs are 3rd party driver crashes, reducing our "trustworthiness" to the user (trust is more than security and privacy). Yesterday, <A href="http://www.devsource.ziffdavis.com/article2/0,1759,1624782,00.asp">DevSource reported on a new driver model in Longhorn</A> that will isolate the OS from driver crashes and simplify the development platform to reduce crashes in the first place. Amen, brother.</P>
