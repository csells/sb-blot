<h1>Swag for the June 29 Portland Nerd Dinner</h1>
<P>I was doing my periodic t-shirt down-sizing and have gathered a couple dozen t-shirts that I thought I'd donate to my local geeks instead of to my local Good Will (who just don't seem to appreciate them). The pile includes a bunch of DevelopMentor t-shirts, including some of the vintage COM Is Love t-shirts (although I'm keeping Essential Marketing and I'm With CAFEBABE). I'll bring the t-shirts to <A href="http://snowstormlife.com/blogs/bliz/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e180628a-97dd-45a6-8e55-3b88eb3c619c">the June 29th Portland Nerd Dinner</A>.</P>
<P>And if you're attending <A href="http://snowstormlife.com/blogs/bliz/PermaLink.aspx?guid=e180628a-97dd-45a6-8e55-3b88eb3c619c">the PND</A>, don't forget to ask me for the letter I wrote to the CEOs of AOL and CompUSA. It made <A href="http://www.neopoleon.com/">Rory</A> repeatedly gasp in amazement.</P>
