<h1>Useful Avalon Application: Pong</h1>
<P>As cool as <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/f873638f-a3ec-4574-932d-d939b336ead2">XamlPad</A> and <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/archive/2004/11/23/268252.aspx">Bouncing Boing Ball</A> are, I've had at least one blog comment from someone looking for a <EM>useful</EM> Avalon CTP application (something not targeted at developers, I'm guessing). Well look no more, because <A href="http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=93dae8e0-9c0d-45c6-b406-b95722400985">we have Pong</A>! What more use can we expect from our computers than that?!? : )</P>
