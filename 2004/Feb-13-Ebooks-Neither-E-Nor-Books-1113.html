<h1>Ebooks: Neither E, Nor Books</h1>
As a computer boy and a producer of words in a row (and a frustrated novelist), I found <A href="http://craphound.com/ebooksneitherenorbooks.txt">Cory Doctorow's thoughts on eBooks</A> specifically and copyright in general to be very interesting. Don't know that I agree, but what fun is it to only consume content with which you agree? That's why I always listen to Rush when I can. : )
