<h1>On Threat Modeling</h1>
<P>Lately, when the subject about how to actually secure a .NET app or component comes up, a magic phrase is uttered: "threat modeling." Apparently, this is the thing that tells you how folks could use your well-intentioned code to do bad things. And on a mailing list with a fairly select membership (although not <EM>too</EM> select -- I'm on it : ), the Swiderski, Snyder book <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619913/chrissells">Threat Modeling</A> was recommended. And the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=62830f95-0e61-4f87-88a6-e7c663444ac1">free threat modeling tool</A> that goes along with the book is hosted right on microsoft.com, which I take as a sign of quality. <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619913/chrissells">Model those threats</A> towards a happier, healthier you!</P>
