<h1>"We're full speed ahead on the R&D for speech"</h1>
<a href="http://www.drobnik.com/oliver/default.aspx?key=2004-02-01T23:34:36.8520576+01:00#comments">Here</a>. <P>Oliver Drobnik&nbsp;extracted a question out of a Q&amp;A session with BillG asking about speech recognition in Longhorn. After BillG makes a very funny comment, he talks about the current state of speech recognition and synthesis today and a bit about the plan for Longhorn.</P>
<P>And Oliver? I'd rather not know what you're planning on commanding your computer to do... : )</P>
