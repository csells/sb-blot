<h1>Rory Hosts .NET Rock While Chris Adds Color</h1>
The tables are well and truly turned from when <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6feadfd0-6ba6-4c7f-a51a-e1cb32f8af7d&amp;DisplayLang=en">I interviewed Carl with Rory acting as color man</A> to where <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cfranklin/archive/2004/03/29/101241.aspx">Rory is hosting and I'm just there to fill a seat</A>. The guest is Tony Bain, who is new to me, and the topic is SQL Server apps, which, while I'm familiar with the technology, hasn't been part of my production quality app work since embedded SQL was the rage (and I miss it!). Should be interesting at the very most. : )
