<h1>A Man, A Plan, A Canal, A Librarian!</h1>
<p align="left"><i>Saturday, <span class="created">June 
26th, 2004</span></i></p><p>Can't come up with a better palindrome than &quot;a man, a plan, 
a canal, Panama!&quot;? <a href="http://www.norvig.com/palindrome.html">
Write a program and come up with one that's 17,000+ words.</a> I love computers 
and what people do with them.</p><p>The most extreme thing I ever did along 
these lines is when my airplane was circling an airport for some unknown reason 
and the United flight attendant announced a contest to keep our minds off the 
dwindling fuel and the terrorists on the ground (oh, wait, that's Die Hard...). 
Anyway, she offered a free bag of peanuts (or something of equal value) to the 
person that could come up with the most words of 3 or more letters from the 
letters in the word &quot;united&quot; (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/">Always 
Be Closing</a>...).</p><p>Did I put my Tim Ewald-expanded vocabulary to work? 
Did I scratch words onto a cocktail napkin as fast as I could think of them?</p><p>
No. In the limited time I had, I wrote a program that would come up with random 
combinations of letters in brute force fashion, then dumped the unique ones to a 
file so that I could use Word's spell checker to find the real words. I came up 
with 32. Did I win?</p><p>No. A librarian, using her own expanded vocabulary 
beat me with 34 (I had been running the program to generate 1000 possibilities 
to speed testing but forgot to flip it back to 10,000 when it came time to run 
it for real).</p><p>Did I stop there? Did I accept defeat gracefully, especially 
since it's pretty clear I had cheated in the first place?</p><p>No. I went home 
and learned the STL permutation algorithm and wrote <a href="/public/tools/WordFind.zip">
a program that compared against a dictionary from the web</a> to find the 72 
words of 3 or more letters in &quot;united&quot; (including asynchronous updates to the UI 
as possibilities are checked [it takes a little longer, but it's worth it...]).</p><p><img border="0" src="/public/spout/wordfind.jpg" width="405" height="420"></p><p>
Now I carry that program on my laptop wherever I go, just in case I run into 
that damn librarian again...</p><p>P.S. I did get to use my program one more 
time against my mother playing Scrabble. I got my all-time high Scrabble score 
ever on that day. She still beat me. Did I mention she's got a bachelor's degree 
in library science? Damn librarians...</p><p align="left"><a href="/1420">
