<h1>Amazing Application of Data Visualization</h1>
<a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/zipdecode/">Here</a>. <P>Type in a zip code and see the scope of it's location narrowed as you type more digits. Simple but powerful way to visualize data that doesn't involve listboxes or datagrids.</P>
<P>I'd like s/w engineers around the world to open their minds to the possibility of alternate data visualizations. It is possible for engineers to have these kinds of thoughts. I know because I spent some time learning a little bit about Adobe Illustrator over XMas and then recently was able to build a logo from scratch for a little investment business my brother-in-law and I are starting up. Until I let myself believe that I could do it, I had always let other people do this kind of work for me.</P>
<P>Jeez, I sound like <A href="http://www.tonyrobbins.com/">Tony Robbins</A>...</P>
