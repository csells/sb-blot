<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/18/technology/18chip.html?ex=1392440400&en=59b3f2d82bbc0431&ei=5007">Here</a>. Intel decides to follow along after AMD's success in adding 64-bit support to the x86 instruction set that Intel invented. Without AMD, we'd all be paying way more for chips, plus we'd all be buying Itaniums whether we wanted them or not. Thanks AMD. Thanks capitalism.
