<h1>Good Idea: Builders in Visual Studio Code View</h1>
<P>I really love Mitch's idea for a "Builder" in the Visual Studio Code View:</P>
<P><A href="http://notgartner.com/posts/509.aspx" height="246" width="423"><IMG src="http://notgartner.com/images/7/r_BuildersCloseup.PNG"></A></P>
<P>There are tons of hidden strings in code that would benefit from such a thing, e.g. data provider-specific connection and query strings, and I'd gladly rebuild <a href="/12416">my FormatDesigner</A> as a Builder. I wonder if <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/">the VSIP SDK</A> is powerful enough to implement it...</P>
