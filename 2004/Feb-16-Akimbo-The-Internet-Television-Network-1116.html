<h1>Akimbo: The Internet Television Network</h1>
<a href="http://www.akimbo.com/whatis.html">Here</a>. <P>At <A href="http://www.demo.com/">Demo</A>, <A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert</A> finds <A href="http://www.akimbo.com/">Akimbo</A>, which marries a Personal Video Recorder to the video content currently being produced for the Internet. For those Internet programs that haven't already done so, I assume that they'll be adding commercials, but right now, this is what cable used to be before they started charging me a monthly rate to watch ads. I don't know anything about pricing and I'd like to be able to try it out on my PC first w/o any extra hardware, but Akimbo seems like the next logical step of turning any TV into a view on a/v content, whether it's live or cached, broadcast or downloaded.</P>
<P>The final step, I think, is to be able to consume any of my cached a/v from any PC/TV in my house, whether the a/v is cached manually by ripping a CD or&nbsp;DVD or whether it's cached automatically via a&nbsp;hunk of&nbsp;PVR software running on a server. Can I do that today w/o spending thousands of dollars?&nbsp;Is&nbsp;<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/devices/xboxextenderkit.asp">the XBox Media Center Extender</A>&nbsp;the answer?</P>
