<h1>Longhorn Concept Video: Health Care</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/productinfo/conceptvid/default.aspx">Here</a>. In this concept video, Carter Maslan, Longhorn evangelist, shows off secure, peer-to-peer networking using pub/sub in Indigo, Longhorn's identity management, organizing data using WinFS metadata relationships, using DRM to keep patient data confidential&nbsp;and some more ClickOnce s/w installation. The&nbsp;application itself shows off&nbsp;a specialist working remotely on a set of real x-rays showing a real case of a person incorrectly sent home having inhaled something he shouldn't and who could have really used a specialist on demand.
