<h1>Do You Think IE Sucks?</h1>
More and more, my smart friends are switching from IE to something else (I've heard mostly about FireFox lately). At a recent blogger conference filled, by definition, with a bunch of web techno-wonks, only something like 15% of the audience admitted to using IE. If you hate IE enough to deal with the integration issues, you must really hate it. Why not let unleash that hatred on the IE team? <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">The IE team is blogging now and would love to have a giant catalog of the specific things that you hate about it.</A>
