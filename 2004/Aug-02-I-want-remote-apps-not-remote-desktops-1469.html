<h1>I want remote apps, not remote desktops</h1>
<P>Ever since WinXP, I've been using Terminal Server a ton. Recently, I've been using Virtual PC and when Virtual Server is released, I bet I'll be using a lot of that, too.</P>
<P>However, as enabling as TS and VPC are, I want more. Instead of logging into a desktop and having the windows trapped on that desktop, I want the windows from a VPC or TS session to just show up on my local desktop, maybe using title bar colors to tell me which ones are running on which machines. I know that X-Windows has provided this for a while, but I want this for Windows. That is all.</P>
