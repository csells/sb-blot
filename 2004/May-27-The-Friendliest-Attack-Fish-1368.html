<h1>The Friendliest Attack Fish</h1>
<P><A href="/1364">As Don pointed out</A>, I missed one of the new companies spawned by DevelopMentor alum: Barracuda.NET, a training company founded by two of the friendliest and funniest instructors you will ever meet (and to whom the Visual Basic community needs no introduction): <A href="http://www.barracuda.net/aboutus.aspx">Ted Pattison and Jason Masterman</A>. Right now these two are specializing in SharePoint training, including remote training (I want to know how they do that!), but I expect them to branch out into all kinds of interesting stuff.</P>
