<h1>MSDN Designer Posts Fun Longhorn Stuff</h1>
<P>Peter Stern, one of MSDN's most excellent user experience and graphic designers, has started up <A href="http://petersterndesign.com/">a web site</A>, with <A href="http://petersterndesign.com/longhorn.htm">a special section just for fun Longhorn-related stuff</A>, including a complete deck of card faces in XAML and his drawings of yours truly from <A href="http://msdn.com/longhorn/">the Longhorn Developer Center</A> in XAML format.</P>
<P>I've been corrupting Peter's thinking toward Longhorn for a few months now and I've fabulously happy to have him as the other half of that magical ying/yang designer/developer relationship that Avalon fosters.</P>
