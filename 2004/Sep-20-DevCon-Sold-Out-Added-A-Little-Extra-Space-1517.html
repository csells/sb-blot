<h1>DevCon Sold Out; Added A Little Extra Space</h1>
<a href="/public/conference/">Here</a>. <P>After only 5 weeks of registrations, <A HREF="/public/conference/">the Applied XML Developer's Conference</A> has sold out. With 4 weeks of registrations left to go, <STRONG>we've gone back to the venue for extra space</STRONG>. It's not much extra space, though, so if you want a seat, <A href="https://www.pluralsight.com/events/devcon/secure/register.aspx">you should register expeditiously</A>.</P>
