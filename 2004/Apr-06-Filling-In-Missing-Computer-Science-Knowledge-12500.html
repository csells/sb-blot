<h1>Filling In Missing Computer Science Knowledge</h1>
<p align="left"><i>
Tuesday, <span class="created">April 6, 2004</span></i></p><p align="left">Sometimes I get emails from folks 
that don't have a formal computer science knowledge and want the benefits of one 
w/o actually going back to college. Since I was disappointed in my own formal 
education (despite going on to &quot;better&quot; my BS in Computer Science with an MS), I 
can understand this desire.</p><p align="left">My first thought was <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">
the MIT Open Courseware</a>, which has a full course of computer science 
curriculum. However, while the course material is all there, unless there are 
officially sanctioned forums for each course, there's really no place to ask 
questions even of fellow students.</p><p align="left">After thinking on it for a 
while, I thought I'd go right to my favorite source. <a href="http://www.lfc.edu/~hummel/">
Prof. Joe Hummel</a> is a professor of computer science at Lake Forest College 
in Illinois and has spent a lot of time thinking about how to fill in missing CS 
knowledge in professional programmers (VB programmers, mostly) at DevelopMentor. 
Here's what he said:</p><blockquote><i>For starters, I'd recommend a book by 
	Brookshear called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201781301/chrissells">
	&quot;Computer Science: an overview&quot;</a> (8th edition). It's written for those 
	new to CS, but introduces lots of nice CS concepts like algorithm analysis, 
	theory of computation (e.g. that some problems cannot be solved!), and other 
	things like OS, networks, DBs, etc. It's a great starter book. After that, 
	I'd recommend books on data structures and algorithms. After that, it really 
	depends on what his interests are: Programming Languages? Theory? Operating 
	Systems? Distributed Systems? Software Eng? AI?</i></blockquote><p><a href="/1267">
