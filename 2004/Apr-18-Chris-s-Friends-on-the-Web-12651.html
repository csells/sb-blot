<h1>Chris's Friends on the Web</h1>
        <p align="left">
            If you're looking for <b>my wife, Melissa,</b> her email address is <a href="mailto:msells@sellsbrothers.com">
                msells@sellsbrothers.com.</a> Her email is pretty reliable now, so send her 
            some! It makes her so happy...
        </p>
        <p>
            My brother-in-law and sister-in-law, <b><a href="mailto:howiefamily@earthlink.net">Joel and Beth Howie</a></b> are online 
            again. Drop them a line.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another friend of mine since grade school, <b>Pete Clark,</b> is 
            just coming off his hiatus 
            recovering from a dot-bomb and spending time with his new child. He 
            is now the principle in
            <a href="http://www.pclark.net/">pclark.net 
            Consulting, LLC</a>.</p>
        <p>
            If you live in Portland, OR and you'd like to get together for breakfast with a 
            group of <b>"congenial nerds,"</b> check out the
            <a href="http://www.slowtrain.placo.com/nb/nerdbreakfast.jsp">Nerd Breakfast Home Page</a>. I like to get there myself when I'm not 
            traveling (or sleeping in : ).
        </p>

            This just in!&nbsp; Matt Pietrek's wife took this pic of (left to right),
            <a href="http://www.donbox.com/">Don Box</a>, me and
            <a href="http://www.wheaty.net/">Matt Pietrek</a>. 
            Sorry about the lack of a smile. I was having a lot of fun hanging out at 
            Matt's house that day, but can never manage to smile for the camera. BTW, ask 
            me to tell you how all of us spent hours debugging a screensaver that day...
