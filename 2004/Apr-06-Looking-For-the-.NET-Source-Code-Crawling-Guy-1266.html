<h1>Looking For the .NET Source Code Crawling Guy</h1>
I gave a talk at the Twin Cities .NET User Group in Minneapolis in January and I met a guy there building a web sit to crawl .NET source code on the web. I didn't get his contact info and he didn't email me, so I don't know how to get a hold of him. If that's you, <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=I'm the .NET Code Crawling Guy">please drop me a line</A>. Thanks!
