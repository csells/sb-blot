<h1>Web Site Dedicated to Extending VS.NET</h1>
<P>I swear I only stopped reading blogs for a coupla days, but interesting news has just surged! For example, I just found out that MSDN has <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/">an entire web site dedicated to extending VS.NET</A>. This includes the legendary VSIP and a set of extensions that lets you build VSIP packages in managed code. Very cool.</P>
