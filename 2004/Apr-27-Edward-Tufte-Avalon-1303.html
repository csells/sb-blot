<h1>Edward Tufte + Avalon</h1>
It's my belief that the big deal with Avalon is that it gives us much more powerful tools to deal with data visualization and manipulation. Towards that end, <A href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward</A> turned me onto <A href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</A> at lunch today and I've got <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0961392118/chrissells">"Envisioning Information"</A> on it's way to my house as we speak.
