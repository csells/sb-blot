<h1>I want Facetop for Longhorn</h1>
<P><A href="http://rockfish-cs.cs.unc.edu/pubs/TR04-008.pdf">Facetop</A> has been all over the web for a couple of days and I'd like to point out two things about it:</P>
<OL>
<LI>This is exactly the kind of thing we're enabling with the advanced client capabilities in Longhorn that you just couldn't do in a web app. Until you see something like this, you don't think of it, but when you've got advanced capability in the platform, all kinds of cool stuff happens that the creator of the platform (Apple's Mac OS X, in this case) never considered. I fully expect the coolest Longhorn apps to come from someone outside of Microsoft.</LI>
<LI>I want it!</LI></OL>
