<P>Ah, <A href="http://www.barracuda.net/BarrysBlog.aspx">the bittersweet memories</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Maybe you have heard some of the stories about the [DevelopMentor] Brains? Brian Randell delivered a VSLive conference talk in a bath robe. Don Box delivered a conference talk in Amsterdam naked from the waist down.
