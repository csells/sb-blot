<h1>WinHEC Avalon NNTP *Dude*</h1>
Kenny Lim has posted <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/digitalnetbizz/archive/2004/05/13/131332.aspx">the source</A> to his <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/digitalnetbizz/archive/2004/05/11/130291.aspx">WinHEC-compliant Avalon NNTP Reader</A> (<A href="http://digitalnetbizz.50megs.com/nntp.JPG">screenshot here</A>). It's stateless right now, but WinFS seems a natural for keeping this kind of state as soon as we're allowed to extend the WinFS type system. Thanks, Kenny!
