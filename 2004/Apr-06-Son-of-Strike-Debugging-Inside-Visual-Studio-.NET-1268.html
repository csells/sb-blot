<h1>Son of Strike Debugging Inside Visual Studio .NET</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/06/Bugslayer/default.aspx">Here</a>. <P>In his June '03 Bugslayer column, John Robbins made a sideways comment when discussing Son of Strike (SOS), a debugging extension from Microsoft for doing all kinds of low-level, mixed native and managed code debugging.</P>
<P>What Jon said was this: "Interestingly, starting with Visual Studio&#174; .NET 2003, you can load SOS when doing mixed-mode debugging." And then he didn't say <EM>how</EM> to load SOS into VS.NET, even after spending the rest of the article telling us how cool SOS was.</P>
<P>Luckily, Mike Stanton, an SDE on the CLR team, has created <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mvstanton/archive/2003/12/04/41241.aspx">a set of instructions for loading SOS into VS.NET</A>. Actually, he posted those instructions in December of last year, but it wasn't 'til today that they were accurate because it wasn't 'til today that I tried them and couldn't get them to work. Now they are and I can and I have all kinds of low-level goodness to explore with Son of Strike.</P>
