<h1>Smart Client Language Translation in Longhorn</h1>
<P>Jason Nadal builds <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jnadal/archive/2004/02/15/73357.aspx">a useful smart client application in Longhorn for language translation</A>. It's a simple front-end to a web service, but it's the first real custom app for Longhorn I've seen that doesn't have to do with demonstrating or building for the platform.</P>
