<h1>Chad on the Visual Studio Team Wants To Meet You</h1>
<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chadroyal/archive/2004/05/14/132307.aspx">Chad says</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"You are important to me! You spend your money and time on VS, and you expect VS to help you make more money and time. You will be using Whidbey to make your living, paying for braces and college and retirement, buying coffee and beer and cigarettes, contributing to political and social causes, paying income taxes and mortgage interest, ordering pizza and books and flowers."</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chadroyal/archive/2004/05/14/132307.aspx">Chad wants you to send him your picture and some info</A> so that he can show his VS team that their customers are real folks. I sent him mine; I may be an MS employee, but I've been using Visual Studio non-stop since it was called QuickC and I <EM>care</EM> what those guys do with my development environment of choice!</P>
