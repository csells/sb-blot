<h1>Short, but Revealing, Interview of David Treadwell</h1>
<P>David doesn't get many questions to answer about the present and future of .NET, but <A href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/02/27/09FEmsnetguthrie_1.html?s=feature">the ones he gets asked, he answers well</A>. My favorite:</P>
<P>"As for code identity, I love the vision. But I&#8217;ll acknowledge that it hasn&#8217;t taken off as we&#8217;d hoped. When people tried to write partial-trust apps, it always turned out there was one thing they needed to do and couldn&#8217;t. We have to do more work to find the right scenarios where you can do a functional smart-client app that runs in partial trust and doesn&#8217;t require the user to micromanage permissions. <EM>In WinFX, I want to make it viable to write partial-trust apps that can do real things.</EM>"</P>
<P>The emphasis is mine.</P>
