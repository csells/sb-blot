<h1>Tons of Fun with Windows Media Encoder</h1>
<P>I've been wanting an easy way to capture screen demos and audio for a while and after stumbling across <A href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/11/11/primetime.html">Jon Udell's post on Movies of Software</A>, I thought I'd <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/9series/encoder/default.aspx">give Windows Media Encoder</A> a try. Here's what I learned:</P>
<UL>
<LI>I really like giving short little vignettes imagining an audience; I didn't think I would</LI>
<LI>The preparation for recording a screen demo is the same as a real demo, i.e. I want to make sure I know what I'm going to demo before I do it</LI>
<LI>The preparation does not include lighting or another person to run a camera or a microphone, which means that I can do it on a whim at 5am on a Saturday morning</LI>
<LI>My built-in mic at normal speaking volume works great</LI>
<LI>Capturing a particular screen doesn't work very well because I'm likely to move between windows without knowing that I will ahead of time. Instead, I should capture a region of the screen, ideally something not too large so that it fits well in a video window</LI>
<LI>Medium quality may not be good enough. I did 13 minutes at medium quality, which resulted in a 3MB file and good audio, but the screen itself was nearly unreadable. Maybe the screen itself was too big?</LI>
<LI>Stop other apps before capturing a screen, otherwise you're bound to get slowdowns in the capture, particularly in the audio</LI>
<LI>Talking in my kitchen at normal volume for 13 minutes will waken my wife (sorry, sweetie)</LI></UL>
<P>So, while I wasn't happy with <A HREF="/public/video/x1demo.wmv">the results</A>, I'm very jazzed about the medium. Expect to see more.</P>
