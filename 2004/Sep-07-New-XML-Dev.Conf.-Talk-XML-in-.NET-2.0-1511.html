<a href="/public/conference/">Here</a>. Neetu Rajpal, a PM on the SQL Server team, has agreed to give us an overview of what's new in XML for .NET 2.0 and in design-time support for Visual Studio 2005 at <A HREF="/public/conference/">the Applied XML Developer's Conference</A>, October 20-21 at the Skamania Lodge in Stevenson, Washington. While I was away enjoying <A href="http://www.burningman.com/">America's version of a nude beach</A>, we've surged to 80% full, so <A HREF="/public/conference/">register soon</A>.
