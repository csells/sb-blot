<P>Michael Weinhardt, who took over my <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/columns/winforms.asp">Wonders of Windows Forms column</A> and is the co-author on the 2nd edition of <A HREF="/public/writing/wfbook">my Windows Forms book</A>, has dedicated himself to <A href="http://www.mikedub.net/windowsformsredux/archives/000005.html">shouting the value of Windows Forms 2.0 from the rooftops</A>. <A href="http://www.mikedub.net/windowsformsredux/index.xml">Subscribed</A>.</P>
