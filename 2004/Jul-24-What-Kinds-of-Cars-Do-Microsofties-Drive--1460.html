<h1>What Kinds of Cars Do Microsofties Drive?</h1>

<P>"I just found your site. I love it!!! It is now a regular read for me.</P>
<P>"I read '<A href="/12394">The Human Side of Microsoft</A>' post on your site and had an idea... What about getting a bunch of people to list what car they drive (or what they used for transport if it is not a car). Aussies tend to be a bit car crazy and you can tell a lot about a person by how they get around!! :-)</P>
<P>"Just an idea.... Take it easy mate.</P>

<P>Brad, I drive a <A href="http://img.epinions.com/images/newworld/879/161761-auto-resized200.gif">1998 Volkswagen Cabrio covertible</A>. It's kinda funny looking and it's a semi-girly color (white), but I fit in it with the top up (I have a long torso, so that's a problem in most convertibles), it's got a good service record, it gets good gas mileage and the Sells brothers still fit in the back (although not for much longer).</P>
<P>Can the other 55,999 Microsoft employees post what kind of car they drive from Brad? Thanks.</P>
