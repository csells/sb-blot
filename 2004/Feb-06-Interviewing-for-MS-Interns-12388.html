<h1>Interviewing for MS Interns</h1>

<p>Shawn Morrissey (my boss)
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/shawnmor/archive/2004/02/06/68714.aspx">
posted some questions he asked at UPenn's Wharton School of Business</a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Explain a database to a young child.</li>
	<li>Explain the Internet to your grandparents</li>
	<li>What is your favorite web site? Why? Now improve it.</li>
	<li>Steve Jobs calls and asks you to improve the iPod. Go. (No bonus points 
	for saying, Add WMA support!)</li>
	<li>Youre in a boat with a rock, on a fresh-water lake. You throw the rock 
	into the lake. With respect to the land, what happens to the level of the 
	water in the lake  goes up, goes down, stays the same?</li>
</ul>
<p>He posted a couple of answers, but you'll have to
