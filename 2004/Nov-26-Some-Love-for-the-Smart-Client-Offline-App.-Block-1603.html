<h1>Some Love for the Smart Client Offline App. Block</h1>
<P>Richard Childress has posted on <A href="http://www25.brinkster.com/rchildress/postView.aspx?id=98">his experiences with the Smart Client Offline Application Block</A> as valuable for not only solving his domain-specific problem, but also in getting .NET to be used at all:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>"Working in IT, where we try to only write code that helps run our business, it's a Great Thing when you don't have to write plumbing code. Writing a class here and another class there, while leveraging a big chunk of code that we didn't write to solve a problem, is golden. This block, itself, is actually helping drive the case for starting to incorporate the framework into our app(s). The value is unquestionable."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
