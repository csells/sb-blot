<h1>A Gathering of Avalon 3D Materials</h1>
<P>Greg Schecter, one of the designers of the new support for 3D in Avalon available in the Longhorn WinHEC build, provides a nice overview and some other links to Avalon 3D resources:</P>

<P>3D support in Avalon is not meant to build Doom 3, but it does shine especially brightly in two places: 1) you can do 3D in a declarative way in XAML, just like the rest of Avalon and 2) as Greg describes, <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/greg_schechter/archive/2004/05/22/139744.aspx">the integration of 2D and 3D in Avalon is nice and clean</A> the way it isn't in most current 3D APIs. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of the 3D support in my own apps, which isn't something I ever considered before with DirectX. Thanks, guys!</P>
