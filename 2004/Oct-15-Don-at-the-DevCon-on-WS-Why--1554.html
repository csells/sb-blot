<h1>Don at the DevCon on "WS-Why?"</h1>
<a href="/public/conference/#WS-Why">Here</a>. <P>Don sent <A HREF="/public/conference/#WS-Why">his new talk</A> abstract my way this morning:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"<STRONG>WS-Why? </STRONG>This talk will make sense of why various WS-* specs came to life and which ones every developer should ignore. Naturally, the size of this set is non-zero, however, it is not the entire universe. Hopefully, the audience will be left with a mental model for what to ignore going forward as the WS-* machine continues to move forward."</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Personally, I've always wondered about the history of the avalanche of WS-* specs and to hear it from an irreverent horse's mouth should be tons o' fun.</P>
