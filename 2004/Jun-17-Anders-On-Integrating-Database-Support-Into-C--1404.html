<h1>Anders On Integrating Database Support Into C#</h1>
<P>Some quotes from <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=10276">Anders on&nbsp;Channel9</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"On of the things that we are trying to think about deeply in C# 3.0 is this big gap that I still see between general purpose languages and databases... Anyone who's building an enterprise app is using both worlds... There's certainly a lot of progress we can make by truly marrying these worlds... It's nothing but mismatch. We gotta do away with that."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now that we've removed memory management from my code and between InitializeComponent and XAML, we've removed the need to write UI layout code, the next big chunk that gums up the works is data integration code. To have Anders thinking about how to extend C# 3.0 to mitigate this problem has me all a tingle!</P>
