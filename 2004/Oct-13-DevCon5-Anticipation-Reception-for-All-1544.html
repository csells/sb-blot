<h1>DevCon5 Anticipation Reception for All</h1>
<a href="/conference">Here</a>. If you're going to be checking into the Skamania Lodge for the DevCon by 7pm on Tuesday, 10/19, please join us for the Anticipation Reception for all attendees and speakers. If you decide to hang with <A href="http://snowstormlife.com/blogs/bliz/PermaLink.aspx?guid=9a050b17-94dc-46c6-853d-371821313b0e">the Portland Nerd Dinner</A> crowd instead that night, I'll understand. : )
