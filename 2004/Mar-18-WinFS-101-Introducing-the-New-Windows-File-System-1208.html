<h1>WinFS 101: Introducing the New Windows File System</h1>
Thomas Rizzo, Director (!) on the SQL Server Product Management team, <A href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/columns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwinfs/html/winfs03112004.asp">kicks off his WinFS column with an overview of why we need it and what it is</A>. I always love the first piece in any column, as it sets the grounding information for what readers are going to need to understand reading future pieces. I especially love them from internal folks, as it really gives a flavor of what the product team (WinFS, in this case), had in mind that drove them to build their thing the way they did. <A href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/Longhorn/understanding/columns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwinfs/html/winfs03112004.asp">Check it out.</A>
