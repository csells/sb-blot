<h1>Why Joe Likes XAML</h1>
<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=18714">Here</a>. <P>Joe Marini is&nbsp;working with Longhorn, Avalon and XAML on a Microsoft product team and finds that he really loves XAML. This, in and off itself, is not surprising (I mean, that's what we're paying him for : ), but it's interesting to hear the specifics.</P>
<P>One thing that Joe seems to love (and I can hardly blame him) is that data binding in Avalon is used to build the UI, not just show external data. He expounds on this in his wonderful <A href="http://www.joemarini.com/tutorials/tutorialpages/xamldataboundui.php">Data Bound User Interfaces in XAML</A> article.</P>
<P>
<P>Another thing that Joe loves is that a Avalon designer's work is in the same format as what the designer needs and can be dropped right into an app w/o converting from bitmap mock-ups (<A href="http://www.petersterndesign.com/longhorn.htm">Peter Stern and I are doing this</A>).</P>
<P></P>
<P>You can read about the work that Joe has done with XAML and download his code samples on his web site's <A href="http://www.joemarini.com/tutorials/index.php">tutorial section</A>. Joe is definitely one to watch in the Longhorn/Avalon space.</P>
