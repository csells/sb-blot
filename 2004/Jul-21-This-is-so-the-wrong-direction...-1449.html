<h1>This is *so* the wrong direction...</h1>
I don't want to <A href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/20/2226225">turn bits into atoms in 3-5 minutes to hold a book in my hand</A>, I want all my books, papers and mags in electronic format on a pleasant hardware platform! I'm planning on getting myself a tablet PC soon to test as a candidate (pocket/palm PCs sucked for this use the last I tried). Plus, where does the book data come from for all of these print-on-demand books and why can't I download it?
