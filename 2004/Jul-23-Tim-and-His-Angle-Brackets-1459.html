<h1>Tim and His Angle Brackets</h1>
<P>Tim Ewald, one of my closest friends and the guy I think deserves to be <EM>much</EM> more famous (the first chapter of his criminally under-selling <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201615940/chrissells">Transactional COM+</A> is worth the price of a Hawaiian honeymoon and is just as fulfilling) is <A href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/">blogging</A>.</P>
<P>In fact, he's been blogging for a few weeks now, but he's teased me before, so I didn't want to point people his way if he was just going to break my heart again. Still, he seems to be on a roll. My most favorite post is <A class=posttitle id=viewpost.ascx_TitleUrl href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2004/06/18/428.aspx">XmlSerializer sans XSD</A>, but <A href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2004/07/23/1680.aspx">his recent post on why he cares about the angle brackets on the wire</A> pushed me over the edge.</P>
<P>Don't disappoint us by going away again, Tim!</P>
<p>BTW, Roger Searjeant built <a href="http://www.searjeant.net/weblog/archives/000076.html">some tools to support Tim's ideas</a>.</p>
