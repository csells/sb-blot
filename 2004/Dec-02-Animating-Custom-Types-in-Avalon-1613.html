<h1>Animating Custom Types in Avalon</h1>
Ian Griffiths illustrates <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/12/02/avaloncustomanimation">the core concepts in Avalon animation</A> by implementing a custom font size animation class. Basically, "animation" in Avalon means "changing an object's value over a range in a given time," e.g. changing a font size from 10 to 72 in 4 seconds or an X coordinate from 10 to 100 in 2 seconds. Animation seemed so fancy to me until I broke it down in my head in this way.
