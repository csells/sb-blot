<h1>General Windows Developer Numbers</h1>
<P><A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/johnmont/">JohnMont</A> (who oughta know) provided these numbers today as "quotable and public" so I thought I would:</P>
<UL>
<LI>There are ~6M professional developers worldwide, about 90% of whom target Windows</LI>
<LI>There are about 2.5M .NET developers</LI>
<LI>&gt;60 of the Fortune 100 develop using .NET</LI>
<LI>Forrester says that 56% of enterprises in North America are choosing .NET for their development requirements vs. 44% choosing J2EE</LI></UL>
<P>According the legend (JohnMont didn't comment on this part), 4-5M of those 6M developers targeting Windows are Visual Basic developers, which means that if they ever get tired of being made fun of by the C family of developers, we're going to be trapped in phone booths while they descend on us like the birds in <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056869/">an Alfred Hitchcock movie</A>...</P>
