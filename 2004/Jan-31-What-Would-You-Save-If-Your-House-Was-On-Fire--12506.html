<h1>What Would You Save If Your House Was On Fire?</h1>
<p><i>Saturday, <span class="created">January 
31, 2004</span></i></p><p>On a recent thread on <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic">
my favorite mailing list ever</a>, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/25771">
Jon Kale answers the question &quot;what would you save if your house was on fire,&quot;</a> 
which triggered my own thoughts along this line.</p><p>Assuming I've already 
made sure that the humans and the pets were out of the house, I'd make sure to 
grab <a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/omega/co_sp_gents_sub?sublineID=375&lineID=117&sexID=63">
my Omega X-33 </a>(purchased during the bubble, of course), but since I go 
almost nowhere without it, it's not likely to be burned up w/o its owner.<br><br>
Also assuming I had a set of back-up CDs/DVDs for the last year in my safety 
deposit box (which I don't have right now... please excuse the pause while I 
purchase a DVD burner... OK, $155 got me <a href="http://www.accupc.com/itemDetail.jsp?pid=DRPIDVR106">
a top-reviewed DVD+R/DVD+RW drive</a> with 30 blank DVD+RW disks delivered), the 
thing I would most miss is my book collection. The computer books could be 
replaced on demand, but my collection of just-for-fun books has literally taken 
a lifetime to collect and cull down to just things that I really love (click on 
the picture to get a closer look).</p><p><a href="/public/spout/bookcool.jpg"><img border="0" src="/public/spout/bookcoolthumb.JPG" width="528" height="396"></a></p><p>
Often, when I want something comfortable to read, I'll scan the shelves 'til 
something pops out at me and re-read it. Also, when friends &amp; family come to 
town, I often take them to <a href="http://www.powells.com/info/storeinformation.html">
Powell's City of Books</a> and we play the &quot;Top 5 Books of All Time&quot; game, 
purchasing what they point out for me and writing their name in the book so that 
when I read it, I can talk about it with the recommender (man, I've gotten some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375703764/chrissells">
wacky books</a> that way...). Losing those books, especially the ones I haven't 
gotten to yet, would <i>really</i> hurt.</p><p>On the other hand, because you 
never know when you're going to need to jam, my goal is to fit my entire set of 
positions on a memory hypercube (or whatever). But how do I back up the books 
when the atoms themselves are so satisfying? I mean, how can I recapture the 
feel of my leather-bound <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/068140969X/chrissells">
The Complete Frank Miller Batman</a>, the back-pocket-worn <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345337638/chrissells">
The Silicon Mage</a>, my copy of The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings signed by 
my mother when I received my Master's Degree because she read them to me when I 
was 10 or the ancient copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0517220784/chrissells">
The Complete Sherlock Holmes</a> given to me by my father and to him by his 
father?</p><p>But even if I wanted a lossy digital backup of my books, how do I 
do it? I mean, I can scan all of my books and graphic novels, but only by 
destroying them. Why haven't books, which are produced in digital form, made the 
transition to electronic availability? Are we waiting for the Tablet PC to get 
to a point of ubiquity?</p><p>So, in summary:</p><ul><li>How do I back up my 
	favorite atoms?</li><li>What would you save if your house was on fire (after 
	humans and pets)?</li></ul><p><a href="/1081">
