<h1>DonXML Updates His SVG2XAML Tool For WinHEC LH</h1>
<P>DonXML has <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/viewuploads.aspx?id=0e769f27-e0d8-4592-b0a9-69fe8bec3b2e">ported his SVG to XAML conversion tool to the WinHEC build of Longhorn</A> and provides the source as well as the binary on <A href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/Workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=0e769f27-e0d8-4592-b0a9-69fe8bec3b2e">his GotDotNet workspace</A>.</P>
<P>Eventually, we'll be awash in real tools that output XAML, but until then conversion tools are important so that <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/peterstern/archive/2004/08/09.aspx">real artists can use the tools with which they're already familiar</A>, output them into a vector format supported by that tool and then convert them to XAML for use in Longhorn apps.</P>
