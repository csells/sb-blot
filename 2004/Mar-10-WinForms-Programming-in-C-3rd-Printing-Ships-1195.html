<h1>WinForms Programming in C# 3rd Printing Ships</h1>
<a href="/public/writing/wfbook">Here</a>. <P>I find it unbelievable that after umpteen books, I finally seem to have blended quality with quantity as the C# version of <A HREF="/public/writing/wfbook">my WinForms book</A> enters it's 3rd printing after only 8 months in publication. Wahoo!</P>
