<h1>Overview of MSBuild, Part 1 of 3</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/msbuildpart1.asp">Here</a>. <P>This week, Christophe Nasarre, one of the best reviewers on <A HREF="/public/writing/wfbook">my Windows Forms book</A>, has written a 3-article series on the new command line build system and the new build core of Visual Studio 2005: MSBuild. In this installment, Christophe starts from the ground floor, building the most basic .proj files and then exploring the advanced features you need to control your builds.</P>
<P>Also, because MSBuild is still under development, this piece covers the details of both the MSBuild in the Longhorn PDC bits as well as the most recent Visual Studio 2005 technology preview.</P>
