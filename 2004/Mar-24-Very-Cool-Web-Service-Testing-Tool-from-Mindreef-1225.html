<h1>Very Cool Web Service Testing Tool from Mindreef</h1>
<P>I knew Mindreef had cool testing tools, but <A href="http://www.mindreef.net/soapscope/wsdldemo">I just found one today on their web site that I ended up using all afternoon</A>. You feed it a WSDL URL and it generates a form, allowing you to see the SOAP request and response packet in several formats include raw XML, to pseudo-code, pretty-printed XML and tree. It's much more flexible then the built in one that ASP.NET provides and the price is right.</P>
