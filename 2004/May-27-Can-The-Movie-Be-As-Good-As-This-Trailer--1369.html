<h1>Can The Movie Be As Good As This Trailer?</h1>
I get to read all of Eric Sink's pieces before we publish them, so I got to follow <A href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/comedian.html">the link to the trailer for Commedian</A> before you guys did (although the movie's been out for 2 years, so you had a <EM>bit</EM> of a lead...). While I like Jerry Seinfield and I've placed this movie next on my NetFlix queue, I can't believe that it'll live up to the trailer.
