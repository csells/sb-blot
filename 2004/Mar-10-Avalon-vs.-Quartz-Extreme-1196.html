<h1>Avalon vs. Quartz Extreme</h1>
<P>If you read <A href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2004/03/08/winfs_detail_3.html?page=1">Ian's article on Avalon Graphics Composition</A> before the fireworks, you missed <A href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a//dotnet/2004/03/08/winfs_detail_3.html?page=last#thread">a wonderful discussion of how Avalon compares with Apple's Quartz and Quartz Extreme</A>. Not only does Ian respond to the ever popular "Doesn't Mac OS X already do today what Longhorn will do tomorrow?" with a resounding "No!" but he does it in such a thorough manner, that you can't help be admire it.</P>
<P>You go, Ian! : )</P>
