<h1>Consider Yourself An Artist</h1>
<P><A href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/dcode/archive/2004/10/14/28584.aspx">d.code has a lot of great stuff to say in his post</A>, but hands down my favorite is this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"How many software developers at Microsoft consider themselves artists first, and software developers second?"</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is the thing that separates today's Windows software from tomorrow's. IMO, this is the line between Windows Forms and Avalon. The former is hands down the best way for software engineers to build professional UIs that we're familiar with under Windows today. The latter is for artists to build things we've never seen before. I know this is scary for software engineers who don't know how to be artists (lord knows I don't) and for companies that don't have artists (better get some), but crossing this line is necessary to get from the best of today to the promise of tomorrow for Windows.</P>
