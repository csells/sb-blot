<h1>Marc Clifton is a Prolific SOB</h1>
<P>I first heard about Marc Clifton on his work with <A href="http://www.myxaml.com/">MyXaml</A>, a&nbsp;declarative UI language that shares a name and some principles with the XAML declarative language in Longhorn, but that works on .NET now. Until today, I had missed his earlier work on this subject: <A href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/aal-1.asp">The Application Automation Layer: Introduction And Design</A>, along with the rest of <A href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/list_articles.asp?userid=36803">his 51 articles on CodeProject.com</A> (wow).</P>
<P>I've never met Marc, but I'd sure like to. He seems like an interesting guy, both because of his work and because of this statement in his CodeProject bio: "Having no formal education in software development, he feels exceptionally qualified to inflict his opinions on the community at large regarding how programming should be done." Now <EM>that's</EM> the kind of attitude I like!</P>
<P>Marc, if you're going to be in the Pacific Northwest anytime soon, <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com">look me up</A>!</P>
