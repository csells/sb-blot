<h1>Let There Be Light In The Darkness</h1>
<p align="left"><i>Thursday, <span class="created">April 1, 
2004</span></i></p><p align="left">I wrote this at the beginning of 2002 while 
channeling my energies into the Windows Forms book. I never published it, but I 
liked it (and I'm in writer avoidance mode as day #2 past my due date rolls by), 
so I thought I'd share it:</p><blockquote>The Dark Ages, a period of five 
	centuries beginning in 5 AD, marked a time of intellectual darkness and 
	barbarity. A ruling feudal class kept a firm grip on their over-worked 
	peasants in small enclaves eking out a meager living from the soil. Only 
	lonely, isolated monks were able to record knowledge using primitive tools 
	to painstakingly inscribing it into hand-crafted volumes, each unique and 
	each unavailable to their fellow man. Only pilgrims and adventures, willing 
	to endure long journeys and brave many hardships, had the chance of 
	obtaining this secret knowledge. Finally, the Renaissance, brought on by the 
	spread of knowledge in approachable formats using inventions like the 
	printing press, was able to rejuvenate a weary world and bring about a 
	period of intellectual growth and achievement that continues to this day 
	(interrupted only briefly by the Reagan years).</blockquote><blockquote>The 
	Browser Age, a period of ten years beginning in 1991, marked a time of 
	user-interface limitations and lowest common denominators. A ruling 
	standards body kept a firm grip on their over-worked participating members 
	in companies large and small, eking out a meager living from IPO wind-falls. 
	Only lonely, isolated web masters were able to record knowledge, using 
	primitive HTML to painstakingly code it into hand-crafted pages, each unique 
	and each unavailable to their fellow programmers. Only Perl programmers and 
	regular expressionists, willing to parse tangled byte streams and scrape 
	many screens, had the chance of separating the data from the presentation. 
	Finally, .NET, brought on by the spread of the information available 
	programmatically to rich client applications using inventions like Web 
	Services and Windows Forms <i>[ed: and soon, Avalon]</i>, was able to 
	rejuvenate a weary software world and bring about a period of productivity 
	growth and achievement that will continue until long after we retire 
	(interrupted only briefly by the Internet Bubble burst).</blockquote><p align="left"><a href="/1251">
