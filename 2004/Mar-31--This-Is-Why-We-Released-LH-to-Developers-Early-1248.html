<h1>*This* Is Why We Released LH to Developers Early</h1>
<P><A href="http://myxaml.com/marcclifton/">Marc Clifton</A>, a concerned 3rd party,&nbsp;provides <A href="/1241">thoughtful criticism of XAML</A>.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.simplegeek.com">Chris Anderson</A>, Avalon Architect, takes Marc's criticism and provides <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/36697366-bbdb-4f55-8490-3aceafcf391d">a thoughtful response</A>.</P>
<P>Because of where we are in the Longhorn release cycle, i.e. a long way from a release, if the Avalon team agrees with Marc, they can make real changes.</P>
<P>As a result, Longhorn gets better because it's able to accept early, critical feedback. Perfect.</P>
