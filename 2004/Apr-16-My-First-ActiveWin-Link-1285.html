<h1>My First ActiveWin Link</h1>
<a href="http://www.activewin.com/awin/comments.asp?HeadlineIndex=23703">Here</a>. I've been reading <A href="http://www.activewin.com/awin/default.asp">ActiveWin</A> for years to pick up various Windows news tids and bits, but have never been mentioned 'til <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2949">the MSDN Tour</A>. On the other hand, I'm not sure how my boss is going to feel when he learns that all I do (when I'm not giving tours) is blog and collect information about the Microsoft interview process... : )
