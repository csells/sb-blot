<h1>Safe, Even Simpler Multithreading in Windows Forms</h1>
Mike Weinhardt adds a 4th installment to my series on <A href="http://www.mikedub.net/windowsformsredux/archives/000009.html">threading in Windows Forms by illustrating the BackgroundWorker component from Windows Forms 2.0</A>. I have to admit that after I saw this component, I felt very silly for not wrapping my own code up in this form. Thank goodness for .the Windows Forms 2.0 team. : )
