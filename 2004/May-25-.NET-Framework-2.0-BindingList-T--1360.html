<h1>.NET Framework 2.0: BindingList<T></h1>
<P>After spending a bunch of time with various partial IBindingList implementations, I just stumbled onto a brand new one in the Visual Studio 2005 Community Technology Preview: <STRONG>BindingList&lt;T&gt;</STRONG>. It's not done yet, e.g. sorting doesn't work, but the model is certainly what you'd want, e.g. you create a BindingList&lt;Person&gt;, bind it to something smart, like a DataGrid or a DataGridView, and you're able to edit instances of your custom type or add or remove instances, as well as search or sort instances, just like you'd need a custom implementation of IBindingList for today. Very nice.</P>
