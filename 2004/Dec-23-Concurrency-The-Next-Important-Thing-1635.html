<h1>Concurrency: The Next Important Thing</h1>
<P>Because CPU speeds have topped off recently even though I/O speeds continue to increase, <A href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">Herb Sutter posits that the Moore's Law free performance lunch is over</A>, i.e. no more getting faster software by waiting for the next gen of faster hardware. Instead, we'll have to write our apps to be a lot more concurrent to take advantage of hyper-threading, multi-core CPUs and multi-CPU machines if we want our apps to continue to run faster.</P>
<P>What this means to me is that we'll have to have <EM>much</EM> better language-level support for concurrent programming. What we have now sucks. Rocks. Hard.</P>
