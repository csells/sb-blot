<h1>"Interviews are practically worthless for screening candidates."</h1>

<p>Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, discusses
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/Bram/diary.html?start=111">
his thoughts on interviewing</a>, include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;In an interview you can tell if a person is a pleasant 
	conversationalist, and you can give some technical questions to rule out the 
	truly inept, but beyond that you might as well be rolling dice.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;I'd like to note that in an all-male work environment hiring an 
	attractive female is probably good for morale.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Even though work history doesn't correlate with job performance, being 
	a lying sack of shit almost certainly does.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun. : )</p>
