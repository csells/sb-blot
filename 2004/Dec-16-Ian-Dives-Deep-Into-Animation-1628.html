<h1>Ian Dives Deep Into Animation</h1>
<P>I said that <A href="/1613">animation in Avalon is simple</A>. Ian said that <A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/12/16/movingpictures">it's hard</A>. We're both right (I was talking about the programming model and Ian is talking about the nuts and bolts of the implementation), but Ian <EM>seems</EM> more right because of those fabulous example pictures that explain why wagon wheels look like they're going backward. Now if he could only explain why computer screens in movies always look like they've been engineered to invoke seizures, we'd have something!</P>
