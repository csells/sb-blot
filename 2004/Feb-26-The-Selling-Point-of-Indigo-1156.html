<a href="http://benjaminm.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c2d26c0a-0c1e-49a6-b734-40f647c2af3c">Here</a>. <P>Right on, Benjamin:</P>
<P>"The selling point of the Indigo Service model is that it is simple and easy to use.&nbsp; The benefits for developers is that they get all the benefits of enterprise-quality features such as transactions, reliable messaging and security without having to write any code.&nbsp; Letting Microsoft do the plumbing allows developers more time to write code that focuses on solving complex and interesting business problems."</P>
