<h1>Is Autonomic Computing Real?</h1>
Of course, I love the idea: software that fixes its own problems. However, it sounds like something from science fiction requiring machines with human-like intelligense monitoring and fixing themselves. Has anyone used <A href="http://www-306.ibm.com/autonomic/index.shtml">IBM's autonomic computing toolkit</A>? Does it work?
