<h1>Adam Kinney on Avalon Property Triggers</h1>
Adam has <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/akinney/archive/2004/03/25/2849.aspx">a nice, concise sample of property triggers in Avalon</A>, which are a XAML way to change the properties of an object based on an action, e.g. implementing rollover. He also shows a small example of using property triggers with animations to build pleasing transitions.
