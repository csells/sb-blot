<h1>Another Cool Visualization</h1>
<p><A href="http://www.visitorville.com/overview.html">VisitorVille</A> maps your real-time web site data to a SimCity-like environment that you can use to see where folks are going on your site and how they're navigating from one place to another. It does the other web traffic kinds of analysis, too, but the ability to watch your visitors in real-time looks pretty darn cool. This is the kind of thing that Longhorn should be good at enabling.</p>
