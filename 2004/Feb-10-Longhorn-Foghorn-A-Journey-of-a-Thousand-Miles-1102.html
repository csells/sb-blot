<h1>Longhorn Foghorn: A Journey of a Thousand Miles</h1>
<P><EM>"A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step."<BR>Unknown (to me : )</EM></P>  <P>In <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnfoghorn/html/foghorn02112004.asp">this installment of the Longhorn Foghorn</a>, I start my Longhorn implementation of the venerable Windows Solitaire. There is no interesting code yet, but I have explored some of the same decisions any developer will face when starting their first Longhorn application from scratch. Enjoy.
