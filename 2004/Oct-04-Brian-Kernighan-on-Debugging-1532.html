<h1>Brian Kernighan on Debugging</h1>
<P>I saw this in an email from John Mason in PSS today:</P>
<P><EM>"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.&nbsp; Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."<BR>--Brian Kernighan</EM></P>
