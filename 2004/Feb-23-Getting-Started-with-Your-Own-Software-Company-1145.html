<h1>Getting Started with Your Own Software Company</h1>
<P>It's hard to dispute a savvy marketing/business guy who brackets paragraphs with "#ifdef do_as_I_say_not_as_I_do" and sites as potential platform problems that "The user's dog is barking at your app" (the latter had me laughing out loud). <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/business/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software02242004.asp">Eric's latest piece on getting starting with your own software company rocks</A> (as usual : ).</P>
<P>BTW, I've seen the Eric's next piece and a Gary Larson reference had me in stitches, so remember to <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/business/default.aspx">come back next month</A>!</P>
