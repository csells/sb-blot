<h1>Avalon 3D Coordinate System</h1>
<P>Daniel Lehenbauer, an SDE on the Avalon team, has <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/archive/2004/07/19/188075.aspx">a nice explanation of the 3D coordinate space in Avalon with some very illustrative pictures</A>. I've got absolutely no experience with 3D and I can follow what he's talking about. Looks like Daniel should be writing a book...</P>
