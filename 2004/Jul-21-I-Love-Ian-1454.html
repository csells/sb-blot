<h1>I Love Ian</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/07/22/longhorncleartype">In Ian Griffith's latest post</A>, he shows 3 identical (to my eye) upper case Os next to each other and says, "[t]his clearly shows the shortcomings of that implementation" like a normal human can tell the difference!</P>
<P>The funny thing is, I've actually noticed that ClearType on Longhorn was generally better, although I never knew if that was my imagination or not. The thing I love about Ian is that he takes that vague sense of "this seems better" to "let me show you why it's better and I'll show you my own implementation of ClearType as a comparison just for fun." What's not to love? : )</P>
