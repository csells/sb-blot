<h1>Turning Science Into Engineering</h1>
<P>It's generally know that the thing we call software "engineering" is nothing like that. We just don't have anything like the rigor that real engineering disciplines do and we need them. I wonder if <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2004/05/26/142681.aspx">Brian's quest to understand the real software life cycle and codify them</A> constitutes another step down the road that the other engineering disciplines took to become predictable, schedule-able, reliable, budget-able and robust. I hope so.</P>
