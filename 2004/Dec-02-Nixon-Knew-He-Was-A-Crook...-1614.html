<h1>Nixon Knew He Was A Crook...</h1>
<P>but it wasn't until Woodward and Bernstein shared it with the world that he did anything about it. Now that we've got <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/">an Avalon that works with Windows XP and Visual Studio</A>, if there's something about it that you don't like, <A href="http://spaces.msn.com">blog about it</A> or <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.windows.developer.winfx.avalon">post to the Avalon newsgroup</A>. Cry out loud! Don't keep it inside. Don't learn how to hide your feelings...</P>
<P>P.S. I *know* that there are some folks that want the Avalon CTP bits that don't have MSDN subscriptions. You have my most sincere apologies.</P>
<p>P.P.S. I don't mean to call the Avalon guys crooks. Those guys work super hard to build the right thing and they're dying for the feedback. That makes them *very* different than Nixon, who really didn't want the feedback he got. : )</p>
