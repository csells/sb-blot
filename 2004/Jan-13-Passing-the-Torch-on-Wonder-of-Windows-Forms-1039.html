<h1>Passing the Torch on Wonder of Windows Forms</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms12182003.asp">Here</a>. This month, Mike Weinhardt takes over for me on the Wonder of Windows Forms column so that I can concentrate on Longhorn. Mike is the co-author on the 2e of Windows Forms Programming book and a co-author with me on <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/04/Design-TimeControls/default.aspx">a couple of Windows Forms</A> <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/05/Design-TimeControls/default.aspx">Designer integration pieces</A> for MSDN Magazine, so he's well qualified. Plus, as an Ozzie, he's got quite an interesting outlook. Recommended.
