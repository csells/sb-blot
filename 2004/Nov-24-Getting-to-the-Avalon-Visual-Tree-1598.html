<h1>Getting to the Avalon Visual Tree</h1>
It's a common Avalon question: how does XAML get translated into an Avalon visual tree, i.e. the set of Avalon objects? <A href="http://longhornblogs.com/zhanbos/archive/2004/11/23/7571.aspx">In this post</A>, Zhanbo Sun, an SDE/T on the Avalon team, not only shows an example of this translation, but provides the code so that you can see it for yourself. Maybe Chris Anderson will add this feature to <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/f873638f-a3ec-4574-932d-d939b336ead2">XamlPad</A> so that you can see it interactively or maybe Gaston Milano will add it to his <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gmilano/archive/2004/11/24/269082.aspx">VS XAML Viewer</A> so that you can see it inside of Visual Studio... [hint, hint]
