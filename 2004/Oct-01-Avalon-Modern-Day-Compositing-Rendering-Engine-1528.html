<h1>Avalon: Modern Day Compositing & Rendering Engine</h1>
<P>Brian Pepin, Development Lead on the Windows Forms team, has <A href="http://www.urbanpotato.net/default.aspx/document/1849">some interesting observations about Avalon and what it means to developers</A>. I particularly like his take on Avalon vs. Windows Forms for control developers and users:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"[Avalon is] needed by control developers everywhere so they can create controls with great usability without hiring an army of Win32 experts. It&#8217;s needed by end users because they deserve to have great usability in all their applications, not just the ones that Microsoft threw a bazillion dollars at."</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I also like what he has to say about Avalon vs. Windows Forms for application developers:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"It&#8217;s also important to realize that from an application developer&#8217;s perspective, there is little difference between Avalon and Windows Forms. For years there will be interesting controls built from both technologies."</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In other words, Avalon is the necessary next step to build more powerful controls so that users get the most out of their applications without requiring a giant change in development methodology for application developers.</P>
