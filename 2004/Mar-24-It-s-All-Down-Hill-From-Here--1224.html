<h1>It's All Down Hill From Here : )</h1>
<a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/">Here</a>. <P>Rory says:</p>
<blockquote>"I mean, here was this guy who managed to make .NET Code Access Security look like <I>fun</I>. It'd be easier to pull a three-headed monkey in a tutu singing barbershop choir out of your ass, but he still accomplished it. Even <A href="http://qtpi.neopoleon.com/">my girlfriend</A> who didn't know diddly about coding walked away making thoughtful noises to herself. To this day, she sleeps in a blue oversized Chris Sells t-shirt. How many other coders out there have silk-screened images of themselves draped over the nubile naked bodies of women as hot as my little tart of a girlfriend? Not many, my friends. Not many at all."</blockquote>
<P>I'm met Rory's "tart of a girlfriend" and there's really nothing more I need to consider accomplishing. : )</P>
