<h1>SlashDot is Wrong: MCE05 Rocks</h1>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/29/1452230">Here</a>. <P>I'm a <EM>very</EM> happy user of <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx">Windows Media Center Edition 2005</A> and have been for some months. Not only does it allow me unfettered access to audio, video and recorded TV from any PC in the house, but with the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/devices/xboxextenderkit.mspx">XBOX Media Center Extender</A>, I can access all of this from any TV in the house as well (so long as its equipped with an MCE Extender). Further, I was able to use MCE to record several episodes of a yoga TV show for my sister-in-law and burn them onto DVDs with an evaluation&nbsp;copy of <A href="http://www.intervideo.com/jsp/WinDVDCreator_Profile.jsp">WinDVD Creator</A>, making her very happy. I don't know what the "content restrictions" who-ha is about, but MCE05 works <EM>great</EM> for me.</P>
