<h1>Bringing More Than The Normal Pair Of Eyeballs</h1>
For of my most respected colleagues, <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/keith.aspx">Keith Brown</A>, <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/fritz.aspx">Fritz Onion</A>, <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/aaron.aspx">Aaron Skonnard</A> and <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/mike.aspx">Mike Woodring</A>, have split off from DevelopMentor to form <A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/default.aspx">PluralSight, a training and content creation company</A>. Between the four of them, they've authored more than 10 books and 175 technical articles and have more than 50 years of collective experience in all many of technical pursuits in the Windows development community. Good luck, guys!
