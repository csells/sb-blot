<h1>Adam Kinney on Dynamic Animation in Avalon</h1>
Adam Kinney's at it again, this time with <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/akinney/archive/2004/02/10/2471.aspx">a sample of changing an Avalon object's animation properties dynamically</A> to develop an interactive game-like effect. Very cool.
