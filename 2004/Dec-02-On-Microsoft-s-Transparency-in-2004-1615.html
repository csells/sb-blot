<a href="http://www.wincustomize.com/newsBoard.asp?c=1&ID=2840&u=0">Here</a>. <P>Sir Black Xero (?!?) has <A href="http://www.wincustomize.com/newsBoard.asp?c=1&amp;ID=2840&amp;u=0">a review of Microsoft's increasing openness in 2004</A>, summarizing it this way:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

<P dir=ltr>Frankly, I'm pleasantly surprised at how far Microsoft has come opening up to the world. I hope we're at a critical mass where it just can't be stopped, but as an engineer, that's hardly surprising. : )</P>
