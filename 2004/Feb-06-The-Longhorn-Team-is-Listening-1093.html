<h1>The Longhorn Team is Listening</h1>
<P>As I've mentioned, the reason we're put the Longhorn preview bits out&nbsp;<EM>so</EM> early is so that we can get feedback at a time when things can still change. So, when you see <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/">Brad Abrams</A>, <A href="http://www.simplegeek.com">Chris Anderson</A> or any of the other dozens of MS PMs and Architects hanging out on the web ask for feedback on what they can do to make things better, take them up on it! Don't be shy. If you hate something, tell us so we can change it! If you love something, tell us so we <EM>don't</EM> change it!</P>
<P>Even if there isn't any specific blog entry to which you can reply, start or your or post something to <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/">the WinFX newsgroups</A>. We've got members of the Longhorn team looking everywhere for your feedback. For example, yesterday <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/archive/2004/02/05/67911.aspx">Dino posted</A> a theory he had about developer reaction to some particular aspect of the new Longhorn programming model. <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/">Rob Relyea</A>&nbsp;saw that post and today <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/archive/2004/02/06/2374.aspx">he's soliciting more feedback on XAML compound property syntax</A> and <A href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/rrelyea/archive/2004/02/06/2375.aspx">XAML as a whole</A>, the latter specifically becase of Dino's post.</P>
<P>If you care enough about Longhorn to be running it at this stage, you really should take these guys up on their offers and use <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/community/newsgroups/">the newsgroups</A>. And if you're afraid that you're not getting your feedback seen, <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Longhorn Feedback">drop me a line</A>. I can't guanartee that your feedback will be incorporated, but I can make sure the right folks see it.</P>
