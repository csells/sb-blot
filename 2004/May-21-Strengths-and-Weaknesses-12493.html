<h1>Strengths and Weaknesses</h1>
<p align="left"><i>Friday, <span class="created">May 21, 2004</span></i></p><p align="left">
I took a Gallup questionnaire and 3-hour seminar on the philosophy of 
strength-based development. The central idea is to identify one's strengths and 
concentrate on those. This is opposed to general thinking which says that you 
should work on your weaknesses. According to Gallup, no one can really change 
their weaknesses much, but if you focus on your strengths, you can really make a 
difference in yourself.</p><p align="left">As evidence of this claim, Gallup 
sites a study of teaching speed reading to average and above average readers. 
The average readers started at 90wpm and the speed reading course increased 
their speed to 150wpm, an increase of 67%. The above average readers started at 
350wpm and increased by more than 800% to 2900wpm. Or, to put it another way, it 
was 10x more effective to concentrate on a strength than to try to improve a 
weakness.</p><p align="left">The dark subtext of the strength-based point of 
view is that if I can't really fix my weaknesses, then I can only really do well 
in certain kinds of ways. I don't like this idea. It sounds too much like fate, 
which just pisses me off because I don't like the idea that it's my nature and 
not my effort that determines how well I do at something.</p><p align="left">
When I mentioned this to one of instructions of the seminar, she looked at my 
strengths and said, &quot;Oh, I see why you want to think it's you that governs how 
well you do,&quot; which didn't make me feel any better. My strengths, in order, are 
Achievement, Command, Communication, Learner and Intellection. In other words, I 
like to get things done, tell people what I think, learn new things and think 
about them. This set of strengths wasn't really a surprise, but here's one: I 
think DevelopMentor was speed reading for my particular strengths. DM was an 
environment that encouraged all of my strengths and I stumbled onto it by pure, 
dumb luck.</p><p align="left">On the other hand, before DM, I wasn't nearly the 
Communicator that I am now. In fact, I think it would've been one of my 
weaknesses had I taken the Gallup questionnaire 10 years ago. And if that's the 
case, I would have been discouraged from spending too much time working on it 
by, for example, teaching, presenting at conferences and writing courses, 
articles and books, which I think would've been a shame, because I really love 
to write.</p><p align="left">So, while I like the idea of concentrating on one's 
strengths, I still don't like the idea of ignoring one's weaknesses.</p><p align="left"><a href="/1356">
