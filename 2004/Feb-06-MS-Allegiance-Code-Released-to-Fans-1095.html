<h1>MS Allegiance Code Released to Fans</h1>
Apparently, even though Allegiance wasn't a commercial success for Microsoft, the fan base is very loyal. So loyal, in fact, that MS Research has posted <A href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/allegiance/">the Allegiance source code</A> to the community. I've never played Allegiance (or heard of it, for that matter), but the trailers on <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/allegiance/home.htm">the Allegiance home page</A> made it sound pretty cool. Even cooler is that MS couldn't keep working on the game, but didn't want to leave their fans in the lurch, so the released the source. Is this a thousand points of light or what!?! : )
