<h1>Interactive XAML Editor Preview from Mobiform</h1>
<P>Mobiform is one of two 3rd party vendors that have been building a XAML parser that runs under the current version of .NET. Today, <A href="http://www.mobiform.com/xamlproducts.aspx">Mobiform went one better by releasing a working preview of an interactive XAML Editor</A> that runs under the current version of .NET. Plus, the XAML that I created in the editor works on the PDC Longhorn bits.</P>
<P>Now there's something other than the 101-Key Text Wizard to use when designing XAML for Longhorn. Mind you, what Mobiform has put together isn't Illustrator or even Paint Brush yet, but it's an amazing start.</P>
