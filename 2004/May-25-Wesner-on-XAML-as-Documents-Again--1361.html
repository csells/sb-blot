<h1>Wesner on XAML as Documents (Again)</h1>
<P><A href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2004/05/xaml_as_documen.html">As Wesner notes</A>, <A href="http://longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/?//longhorn.msdn.microsoft.com/lhsdk/appcore/overviews/intro_app_development.aspx">the Longhorn SDK lists 3 distinct Avalon applications types</A>: Windows/Forms apps, multi-page apps and documents. The beauty of Avalon is that it brings so many together, apps/documents, multi-window apps/multi-page apps, text/images/video/audio, 2D/3D, etc. And to answer Wesner, Microsoft <EM>will</EM> provide editing tools for Avalon beyond Notepad (someday...).</P>
