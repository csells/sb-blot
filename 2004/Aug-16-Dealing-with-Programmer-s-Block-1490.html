<h1>Dealing with Programmer's Block</h1>
<P>A friend of mine IM'd me just a few moments ago and asked, "When you're sitting in front of a code editor and you have no motivation, what do you do?"</P>
<P>I hereby dub this "programmer's block" and since I've never had it (which I'm just now realizing is pretty weird), I wondering if you can offer my friend some advice. Thanks!</P>
