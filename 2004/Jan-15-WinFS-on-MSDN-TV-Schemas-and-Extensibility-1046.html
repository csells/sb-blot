<h1>WinFS on MSDN TV: Schemas and Extensibility</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20040115WinFSPT/manifest.xml">Here</a>. Patrick Thompson, a PM on the WinFS team, talks about how types are defined in WinFS and how to extend them and create your own (although the extensibility of WinFS isn't enabled in the PDC bits).
