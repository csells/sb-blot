<h1>Getting to Know Avalon - A Guided Tour of the SDK</h1>
Tim Sneath, Avalon evangelist and all around charming fellow (maybe because his name reminds me of a Dr. Suess character?), posted <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/tims/archive/2004/11/22/268197.aspx">a nice little tour of Avalon via the the WinFX SDK</A>. Enjoy.
