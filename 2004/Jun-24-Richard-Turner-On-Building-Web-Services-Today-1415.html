<h1>Richard Turner On Building Web Services Today</h1>
Richard Turner, a PM on the Indigo team, has <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/richturner666/archive/2004/06/23/164201.aspx">some advice about how to build web services while we wait for Indigo</A>. He didn't mention <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=fc5f06c5-821f-41d3-a4fe-6c7b56423841">WSE2</A> specifically, but I assume he means for you to use it when you hit the wall on ASMX for web services implementations, e.g. when you need WS-Security support.
