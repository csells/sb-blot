<h1>WinFS is a Domain Ontology with Style</h1>
<A href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/mwherman2000/archive/2003/11/11/3435.aspx">Michael Herman caught onto WinFS's real nature</A> last year and I'm just now catching up. He points to a paper describing ontologies and points out this about WinFS: "WinFS is a knowledge repesentation, storage and synch system ...a literal implementation of a system strongly based on ontology related concepts." For the basics of ontologies for our new world-to-be, Michael recommends <A href="http://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf">Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology</A>.
