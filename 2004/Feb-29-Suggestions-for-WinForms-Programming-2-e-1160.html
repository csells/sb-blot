<h1>Suggestions for WinForms Programming 2/e</h1>
<a href="/public/writing/wfbook">Here</a>. <P>My co-author for the 2nd edition of <A HREF="/public/writing/wfbook">Windows Forms Programming</A>, <A href="http://www.mikedub.net/default.html">Michael Weinhardt</A>, doesn't have enough to do to with the new features in Whidbey or all of the stuff that I wished that I added to the 1st edition but didn't. No, he wants more, so he asked me to ask you nice folks what you'd like to see.</P>
<P>The goal of the 2/e edition of the book is to cover the features of WinForms Whidbey as well as related .NET features that are important to WinForms programmers. Also, we'd like to continue to encapsulate WinForms community best practices. What did I miss in either of these categories that you'd like to see in the 2/e?</P>
