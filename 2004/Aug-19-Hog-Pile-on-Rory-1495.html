<h1>Hog Pile on Rory</h1>
<P>Rory has posted <A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7623.aspx">his MSDN speaking schedule</A>. I'm already signed up for <A href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;EventID=1032255409">the Portland, OR talk on August 26</A>. I can't wait to hear Rory regale us with "a demo-packed afternoon" where I will "gain valuable insight into .NET development." Plus, we get "a sneak peek at what's coming in ASP.NET 2.0!" What could be better? <A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7623.aspx">Come one, come all!</A></P>
