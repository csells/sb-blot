<h1>Breaking the Mental Logjam</h1>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/productinfo/">Here</a>. <P><a href="/12514">As I've mentioned</A>, one of the biggest problems I see with Longhorn is deciding exactly what to do with all of the new capabilities. So, when Carter Maslan showed me some internal training videos showing off some uses of Longhorn in potential real-world applications, I just knew we had to get them out to the world.</P>
<P>The first such "concept video" is centered around commercial real estate (available at <A href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/d/9/fd9418b1-9440-40ce-8844-845d6fbfaf62/CommercialRealEstate-320x240.wmv">320x240</A> and <A href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/a/a/6aa5bc74-59a4-4673-82e7-4ae2d54e1471/CommercialRealEstate-640x480.wmv">640x480</A>) and Carter's got more planned in other industries, including manufacturing, telecom, financial services and more. The goal is to help break the mental logjam around how we build Windows and web applications today to get folks thinking about the possibilities that Longhorn provides. Enjoy.</P>
