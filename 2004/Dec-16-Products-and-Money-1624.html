<h1>Products and Money</h1>
<P>This one's a double-header:</P>
<P>Eric Sink talks about how to <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/understanding/columns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnsoftware/html/software12142004.asp">find a product to build</A> (if you're a micro-ISV).</P>
<P>Joel talks about <A href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html">how much to charge for your product</A>.</P>
<P>Both are excellent but both convince me yet again that such things are more luck than skill (which sucks for those of us that consider themselves skillful).</P>
