<h1>Call For Speakers: Applied XML Dev.Conf. 5</h1>
<P>Are you interested in presenting a 45-minute talk on some applied XML or Web Services topic? It doesn't matter which platform or OS you're targeting. It also doesn't matter whether you're an author or vendor or professional speaker or a developer in the trenches (in fact, I tend to be biased towards the latter). We're after interesting and unique applications of XML and Web Services technology and if you're doing good work in that area, then <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Applied XML Dev.Conf. 5 Abstract Submission"><FONT color=#000000>I need you to send me a session topic and 2-4 sentence abstract</FONT></A> along with a little bit about yourself.</P>
<P>I'll be taking submissions 'til the end of June, but <A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=Applied XML Dev.Conf. 5 Abstract Submission"><FONT color=#000000>don't delay</FONT></A>. Passion and a burning story to tell count twice as much as anything else.</P>
<p><b><i><font color="red">And don't be shy about spreading this announcement around! I've got good coverage in the .NET and Windows communities, but don't know very many folks in the Java or Unix or hardcore XML worlds, so if you're in that world, let those guys know! Thanks.</font></i></b></p>
<P>BTW, the conference itself is likely to be in Oregon during the 2nd or 3rd week of September, 2004, but we're still working the details out. One of the fun things that we're thinking about this year is to have the Dev.Conf. in <A href="http://www.sunriver-resort.com/">Sunriver, Oregon</A>, a resort and spa town in central Oregon where sun is plentiful and rain is scarce. There are no major airports there, so we'd provide bus transportation from Portland, OR for anyone that wanted it. It'd be a 3.5 hour road trip.&nbsp;<A href="mailto:csells@microsoft.com?subject=My thoughts on having the Dev.Conf. in Sunriver, Oregon">What do folks think about that?</A></P>
