<h1>SVG to XAML Converter</h1>
<P>"The <A href="http://www.xamlon.com/software/xamlconverter/">Adobe&#174; Illustrator&#174; SVG Edition of XAMLConverter</A> is now available for free evaluation. The process is as simple is running XAMLConverter, dragging an SVG exported from Adobe&#174; Illustrator&#174; onto the application and the file is automatically converted to XAML. In addition, XAMLConverter runs the XAML file so you may view the results.</P>
<P>"This edition can convert SVG created by tools other than Adobe&#174; Illustrator&#174;. But SVG exported from Adobe&#174; Illustrator&#174; is the only fully supported subset of SVG."</P>
