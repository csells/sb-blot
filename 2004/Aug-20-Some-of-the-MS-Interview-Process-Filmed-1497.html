<h1>Some of the MS Interview Process Filmed</h1>
Channel9 did what I was unable to ever get done: <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=18472">filmed some of the interview process</A>. It's not an actual interview, but Gretchen Ledgard and Zoe Goldring, both Central Sourcing Consultants at HR for MS, lead you through what to expect at a Microsoft interview, providing <A href="/12383">a wealth of wonderful MS interviewing tips</A>.
