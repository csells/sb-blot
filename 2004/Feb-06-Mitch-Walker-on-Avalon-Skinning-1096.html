<h1>Mitch Walker on Avalon Skinning</h1>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mitchw/articles/68541.aspx">Here</a>. Mitch Walker, the Terrarium guy at MS, posts some tantalizing screen shots from the Longhorn version of Terrarium under development and uses them to discuss the three steps to building skinning support into your Avalon apps. Thanks, Mitch, and when are we going to get Terrarium.Longhorn? : )
