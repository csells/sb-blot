<h1>Enjoyed Listening to Charles Petzold on .NET Rocks</h1>
<P>I really enjoyed listening to Charles Petzold on <A href="http://www.franklins.net/fnetdotnetrocks/dotnetrocks.aspx?showid=78">the most recent episode of .NET Rocks</A>. It was wonderful to hear about an entire part of Windows history when I didn't even know that it existed (I never heard of Windows 'til version 3.1). I was also surprised and honored to hear that Charles was familiar with my book (or the sales numbers at least : ).</P>
<P>BTW, I'm a huge Richard the Toy Boy fan. He's got such a radio voice and entertaining manner that he should do the radio thing professionally (hopefully I'm not embarrassing myself because he's already a professional and I don't know it : ).</P>
