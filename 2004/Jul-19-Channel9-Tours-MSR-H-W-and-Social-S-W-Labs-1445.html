<h1>Channel9 Tours MSR H/W and Social S/W Labs</h1>
I got a sneak preview of this last week and absolutely loved <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=14037">the Channel9 tour of the Microsoft Research hardware and social software labs</A>. The bit with the inventor of the laser printer, who works for MS now, is especially fun. Enjoy.
