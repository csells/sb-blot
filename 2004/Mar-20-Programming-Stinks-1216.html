<h1>Programming Stinks</h1>
<P>As much as I love writing code, I realized long ago that it's really the act of bending my computer to my will that I really love. Programming's just the only way to really do that. After a few decades, you'd have thought we'd have come up with something better. <A href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/rose/2004/03/19/programmers_at_work/index.html">Our industry's pioneers agree that programming is holding us back, but don't really know what we'll use to replace it.</A> Ideas?</P>
