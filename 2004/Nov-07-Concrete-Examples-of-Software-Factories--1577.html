<h1>Concrete Examples of Software Factories?!?</h1>
I've been reading each of <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/overview/softwarefactories/">the Software Factories articles</A> with great interest. Part 1 and part 2 did a particularly good job describing the elements of the problem space, I thought. However, when I get to <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/softfact3.asp">part 3</A>, I was ready to see a solution. Instead what I got was a long abstract piece defining the bits of what makes up a software factory. This is the kind of thing I'd be ready to read after I was shown a concrete example or two of working, running software factories. Do other people like reading these long, abstract articles? I find them tedious unless they're filling in and generalizing the details of something that I've already got a handle on.
