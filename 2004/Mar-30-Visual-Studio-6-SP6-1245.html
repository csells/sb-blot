<h1>Visual Studio 6 SP6</h1>
I used to live and die with Visual Studio Service Packs and the DevDiv Sustaining Engineering team has just released <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp6/default.aspx">another SP for you Visual C++ 6 and Visual Basic 6 programmers</A>. Millions of folks still use these products and it warms my heart that we're 2.5 generations past this, but still releasing SPs. I don't anticipate any more of them, though, so I recommend using this SP for your current projects and moving to Visual Studio .NET 2003 or Visual Studio 2005 on the next one, depending on the timing.
