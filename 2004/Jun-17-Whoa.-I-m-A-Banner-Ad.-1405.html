<h1>Whoa. I'm A Banner Ad.</h1>
If you hit the <A href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/">Microsoft-Watch</A> web site often enough (it's been on 3 of my last 4 visits), you'll see my smiling face as a giant banner ad. Hell, I don't even put my picture up on my own site (well, except <a href="/public/fun/centerfold/">this one</A>...)! Maybe they've got too many hits on their web site and instead of taking it down without warning, they're using my picture to scare folks away. ; )
