<h1>HR Bloggers</h1>

<p>I've heard for years that MS HR uses my site as part of their internal HR 
training, although I've never heard it from the HR folks themselves. Until now.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/heatherleigh/">
Heather Hamilton</a>, an MS recruiter, said that my &quot;site is legendary, 
especially here in staffing.&quot;</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog">Zoe 
Goldring</a>, also an MS recruiter, said &quot;Net/Net  Chriss site is great. Plus 
I respect the fact that he doesnt give the answers to the questions!&quot;</p>
<p>And, to top it off, they're
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jobsblog">even</a>
<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/heatherleigh/">bloggers</a>, and 
they provide a whole host of interesting info for folks interested in 
interviewing at Microsoft. Certainly, I'd trust anything you read on their blogs 
far more than the stuff on this one, most of which was obtained far before I 
ever worked at MS.</p>
