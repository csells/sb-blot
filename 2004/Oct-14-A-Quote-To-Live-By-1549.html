<h1>A Quote To Live By</h1>
<P>I watched the first few episodes of <A href="http://www.hbo.com/films/angelsinamerica/">the award-winning HBO series "Angels in America"</A> and hated it (but <A href="http://www.netflix.com/">I still love NetFlix</A> for making is so darn available to me).</P>
<P>However, while I didn't identify with any of the characters (except, potentially, the hot nurse/angel), I did really resonate with one of the quotes, which went something like this (and feel free to correct me if you recognize the quote and I got it wrong):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Don't run your life by what you want. That changes with a whim. Run your life on what you <EM>believe</EM>."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That really struck the Midwestern Eagle Scout idealist engineer in me.</P>
