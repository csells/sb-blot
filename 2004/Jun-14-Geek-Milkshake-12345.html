<p>My web log brings all the nerds to the yard,<br>
and I'm like: &quot;mine's better than yours&quot;.<br>
Damn right, it's better than yours!<br>
I can link you, but I have to charge!<br>

<br>
I know you want it;<br>
the thing that makes me,<br>
what the geeks go crazy for.<br>
They lose their minds..<br>
the way I whine.<br>
I think it's time:<br>
<br>
la la, la, la, lah<br>
Post it up.<br>
la la, la, la, lah<br>
The geeks are waiting.<br>

<br>
I can see you're on it.<br>
You want me to teach thee,<br>
techniques that freaks these boys.<br>
It can't be bought;<br>
it's just my marketing wrought.<br>
(Track-back if you're smart)<br>

Oh once you get involved,<br>
everyone will look this way, so,<br>
you must maintain your charm;<br>
same time maintain your click-through,<br>
just get the perfect link.<br>
Feed what you have within;<br>
RSS is cheaper than ink.<br>
The geeks pick up your scent.<br>
