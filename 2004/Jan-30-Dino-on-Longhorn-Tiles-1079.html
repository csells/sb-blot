<h1>Dino on Longhorn Tiles</h1>
<P>The shell-meister himself, <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/longhorn/?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/lhtiles.asp">Dino Esposito, digs into the one of the most prominent of the new shell features in Longhorn -- the Sidebar</A> -- by showing you how to add your own tile, including how to create the flyout and properties views and how to extend the context menu. Sample code included. Enjoy.</P>
