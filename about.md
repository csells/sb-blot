Hi. My name is Chris Sells and I’m the founder and chief proprietor of
sellsbrothers.com, the web site HQ for Sells Brothers, Inc. I put this web site
up sometime in 1995 when I could no longer remember the complete list of links I
wanted to share with my students and it just kinda got outa hand from there.

Over the years, the site has been [written and rewritten in the latest
technology of the day](</tagged/colophon>), but fundamentally, it's just a place
for me to write about whatever it is that interests me at the moment, whether
it’s about [something fun](</tagged/fun>) I found on the internet, a tip for
[how to interview well](</tagged/interview>), a [tool that I've
built](</tagged/tools>) and want to share or just general
[opinion](</tagged/spout>).

If you’d like to know more about me or contact me, you’ve got
[Twitter](<https://twitter.com/csells>),
[LinkedIn](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/csells>) and [my
email](<mailto:csells@sellsbrothers.com>). Enjoy.

P.S. While I currently work for Google, this web site represents my own personal
views and opinions and should not in any way be construed as the views or
opinions of my employer or subsideraries.
