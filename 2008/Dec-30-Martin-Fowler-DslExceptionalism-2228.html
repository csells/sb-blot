<h1>Martin Fowler: DslExceptionalism</h1>
<P>I love <A href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DslExceptionalism.html">what Martin has to say on the topic of designing DSLs</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"DSLs are seen as a small and simple subset of general purpose programming thinking. As a result people think that what's true for general purpose languages is also true for DSLs (with the implication that DSLs are too small to be worth thinking much about).</EM></P>
<P><EM>"I'm increasingly of the opposite conclusion. The rules for DSLs are different to the rules for general purpose languages - and this applies on multiple dimensions."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When you're ready, <A href="http://msdn.com/oslo/">Oslo lets you build DSLs</A> to be as simple or as complex as you like.</P>
