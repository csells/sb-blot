<h1>Parsing relative and absolute dates with MGrammar</h1>
<A href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/natural-language-date-dsl-oslo">Dilip Krishnan has built a lovely little date parser</A> that supports absolute dates like "6/2/1969" (just like DateTime.Parse already supports today) and relative dates like "today" or "next Monday" or "5 days from today". I find myself using relative date expressions like these all the time in Outlook and I've love to have them in every app I use that does dates. With Dilip's parser and <A href="http://msdn.com/oslo">the Oslo SDK</A>, you can add it to your app.&nbsp;Good work, Dilip!
