<h1>Where did my old Word command go in new Word?</h1>
I've been using Word for a long time and my fingers knew where the commands were that I used even though my brain didn't. Most of the those commands I've mapped to the new Ribbon-enabled Word without a problem, but sometimes I still search. For those times, the Office guys have put up <A href="http://office.microsoft.com/assistance/asstvid.aspx?assetid=XT100766331033&amp;vwidth=1044&amp;vheight=788&amp;type=flash&amp;CTT=11&amp;Origin=HA100744321033">a cool tool that shows me where the new version of each command is located in the new Word</A>. Enjoy.
