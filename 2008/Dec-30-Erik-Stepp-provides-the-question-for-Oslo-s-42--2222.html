<h1>Erik Stepp provides the question for Oslo's "42"</h1>
I'm just catching up a little after one set of holidays and before another one on Wednesday and I noticed <A href="http://erikwynne.blogspot.com/2008/11/oslo-42.html">Erik Stepp's blog post entitled "Oslo == 42"</A> in my inbox. In his post, he provides a lovely discussion of what Oslo is and why we built it, giving us a concrete example from his own development life. He got it pretty much dead on. <A href="http://erikwynne.blogspot.com/2008/11/oslo-42.html">Check it out.</A>
