<h1>Poetry Proclivities</h1>
<P>I'm not a big poetry fan in general, but notable exceptions are Poe's The Raven (especially the Simpson's version), Dr. Seuss and Shel Silverstein.</P>
<P>However, I have to admit a certain fondness for the lowly limerick. I've done some composing, but the subject matter is often not something I'd want to post on my blog ("Hi, Mom!"), so when I ran into <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry)">the rare clean one</A>, I had to share:</P>
<P>A Limerick packs laughs anatomical<BR>In a space that is quite economical<BR>But the good ones we've seen<BR>Very seldom are clean<BR>And the clean ones so seldom are comical</P>
<P>I've seen <a href="/12362">geek poetry</A>, <a href="/12359">geek activities as song parodies</A>, <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=367997#367997">programs as songs (genius!)</A>, but I've never seen a geek limerick. Got any?</P>
