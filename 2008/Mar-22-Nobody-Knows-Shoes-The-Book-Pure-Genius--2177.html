<h1>Nobody Knows Shoes: The Book -- Pure Genius!</h1>
<P>I friend of mine dropped <A href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1365064">a book with a funny cover</A> in my lap and said, "Hey, check this out." I threw it on my pile and didn't get back to it for a few days. When I did, I didn't know what to make of it. It was like <A href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fk7SawIjG3IC&amp;dq=grapes+of+wrath&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=rrXRrO0QeL&amp;sig=eDw4XNyXJoCrATWoFjrfczgKlKA&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=Grapes+of+Wrath&amp;rls=com.microsoft:*&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail">The Grapes of Wrath</A> by <A href="http://www.neopoleon.com/">Rory Blyth</A>, with illustrations by a drunk <A href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;rls=com.microsoft:*&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=Salvador+Dali&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8">Salvador Dali</A>.</P>
<P>It took a few pages, but I eventually figured out that "Shoes" was a cross-platform GUI framework for Ruby and this 52-page book was a tutorial for it. By page 15, I knew the major concepts. By page 20, I could write my first program. By the end, 30 minutes after I'd started reading, I knew the whole thing.</P>
<P>But it was page 24 that completely blew me away. The use of pictures of dominoes and matches to illustrate layout in stacks and flows was genius. This wasn't just a random collection of wacky illustrations and&nbsp; non-traditional font choices -- the author of this book really knew how to tell a story.</P>
<P>It wasn't that I wanted to program Shoes, so went looking for a tutorial. It was the tutorial that made me want to program Shoes. Now *that's* writing.</P>
<P>P.S. This book is not from a publisher -- it's self-published through <A href="http://LuLu.com">LuLu.com</A>&nbsp;for cost. There is no bar code, copyright page, Table of Contents or index. It's just the stuff you actually need to get started programming a completely new thing. And, if you don't want to shell out the $8.72 to read a paper copy, you can read <A href="http://hackety.org/press/">the HTML and PDF versions</A> instead.</P>
