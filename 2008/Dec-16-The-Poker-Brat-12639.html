<h1>The Poker Brat</h1>
<p>You may or may not know it, but I'm a big poker fan. For a while, I thought 
about quitting my job and being a

poker</a> player. I've studied a stack of poker books and every once in a while, 
I get to be at a table when there's a &quot;moment&quot; -- somebody gets cocky and gets 
beat in just the way they deserve. I've been the cocky guy and I've been the guy

<p>I love seeing Phil get trounced here, but the only thing that makes me wonder 
is, why is Dragomir so upset? I can't help but gloat when I get to beat someone 
like that. : )</p>
