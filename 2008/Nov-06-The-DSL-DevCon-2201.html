<h1>The DSL DevCon</h1>
<P>I'm thinking it's time for another DevCon. I know it's been a while since the last one (in fact, I hear there was some kind of petition to have another one? : ), so we're long past due.</P>
<P>This one will be on all things data-driven, model-based and/or DSL enhanced. I'm thinking March or April&nbsp;of 2009. &nbsp;Who's interested?</P>
