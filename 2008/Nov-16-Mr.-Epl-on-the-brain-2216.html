<h1>Mr. Epl on the brain</h1>
<P>I've been writing my MSDN Magazine pieces introducing Oslo and spending a great deal of time in <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joshwil/archive/2008/11/12/mrepl-a-fun-way-to-learn-mschema.aspx">Mr. Epl mode inside Intellipad</A>. So, at 1:23p on a Sundary afternoon, I'm getting a little loopy, which is manifesting itself as me repeating famous lines from popular culture, only substituting Mr. Epl's name, e.g.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Mr. Epl, I am your father."</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Oh, Mr. Epl, I can't pay the rent!" "You must pay the rent." "I can't pay the rent!"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Help me, Mr. Epl. You're my only hope!"</EM></P>
<P><EM>"Mr. Epl, Mr. Epl, it hurts when I do that!" "Don't do that."</EM></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Did I mention I'm doing the voices, too?</P>
