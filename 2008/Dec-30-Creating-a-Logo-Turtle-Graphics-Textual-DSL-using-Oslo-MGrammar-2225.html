<P>Jason Hogg has posted <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/thehoggblog/archive/2008/11/25/a-logo-turtle-graphics-sample-in-mgrammar.aspx">a very cool Oslo DSL and an interpretter</A> for doing <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Logo Turtle Graphics</A>. He had this to say about MGrammar:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

<P>Thanks, Jason. We try!</P>
