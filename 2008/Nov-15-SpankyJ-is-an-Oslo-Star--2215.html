<h1>SpankyJ is an Oslo Star!</h1>
<P>SpankyJ (Josh Williams) is a star developer on the Oslo team (specifically the MSchema compiler) and he's been doing some very cool stuff with M.</P>
<P>Firstly, Spanky's the author of the Mr. Epl tool, which is a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop program for interacting with M (M-REPL =&gt; Mr. Epl -- cute, eh? When we used to call "M" "D", it used to be Dr. Epl. If we change it to "S", we'll Sen&#243;r Epl! : ). Mr. Epl ships with <A href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/oslo">the Oslo SDK</A>, so if you've installed it, you can find it in <EM>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Oslo SDK 1.0\Bin\Intellipad\Samples\Microsoft.Intellipad.Scripting.M\MREPL.exe</EM> or you can execute it directly inside of Intellipad with the MScriptMode mode.</P>
<P>For a demonstration (and an explanation of how to get MScriptMode working in Intellipad), Spanky has recorded <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joshwil/">a very nice Mr. Epl screencast</A>. Highly recommended.</P>
<P>Secondly, Spanky has just released <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joshwil/archive/2008/11/12/using-mgrammar-to-create-net-instances-through-xaml.aspx">a library for taking the output of MGrammar and producing a graph of .NET objects via XAML</A>. He's got a nice screencast of <A href="http://wm.microsoft.com/ms/msdn/oslo/PersonExample.wmv">using it to create something simple</A> to give you a feel, then he moves right into <A href="http://wm.microsoft.com/ms/msdn/oslo/mwindowexample.wmv">a natural language processor for creating WPF windows and controls interactively</A>. The ability to type text that translated into WPF without using angle brackets demonstrates the potential for DSLs very well, I think.</P>
<P>A few notes when watching Spanky's screencasts:</P>
<UL>
<LI>He has slowed himself down considerably to be clear and understandable and he's done a good job. If you'd like to hear what he sounds like in real life, run the screencast at 1.5x speed. : )</LI>
<LI>He has a blinking red/green light in the taskbar -- what *is* that?!</LI>
<LI>He's a dev that tells a story like a champ -- why the hell does my team even need PMs?</LI></UL>
<P>Anyone interested in Oslo should absolutely subscribe to <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joshwil/">Spanky's blog</A>. I know I have.</P>
