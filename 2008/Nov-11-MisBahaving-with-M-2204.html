<h1>MisBahaving with M</h1>
<P>The M family of languages is meant for all kinds of things, from executable models, e.g. defining a workflow and executing it via the Workflow runtime, to allowing a business person to express something in a language, either visual or textual, that they understand so that it can be communicated as formally as desired to another human. As an example of the latter, <A href="http://www.claudioperrone.com/blog/articles/2008/11/09/misbehave-01-oslos-mgrammar-for-bdd-executable-specifications/">Claudio Perrone has implemented a DSL in MGrammar for Behavior-Driven Development</A>.</P>
<P>It is amazing to me how many of these little DSLs have popped in M just since the PDC. Keep 'em coming!</P>
