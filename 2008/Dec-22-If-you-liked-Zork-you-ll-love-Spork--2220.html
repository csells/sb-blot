<h1>If you liked Zork, you'll love Spork!</h1>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Calibri size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%"><A href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/3/E/E3EC8D15-BF43-4FFB-8B05-FD01F8EC6AD4/Spork.msi">Spork</A> is a sample of an end-to-end application using M and the Repository. It starts by defining a set of M types that describe the data needed for a text adventure along the lines of the famous Infocom game <A href="http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html">Zork</A> (and hence the corporate bad-caf&#233;-inspired name). The M instances are generated by running a custom compiler developed with the VBA (Visual Basic for Adventures) MGrammar grammar. We also provide a runtime driven by adventure data loaded into the Repository in multiple versions of the types called AdvRunner.</SPAN></FONT></P>
