<h1>Generating code from M</h1>
<P>On the Oslo team, we think of three kinds of models:</P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Drawings</STRONG>: This is modeling to communicate from human to human, e.g. on a white board or in Visio. An architecture diagram in a design document is an example of such a thing.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Model-Assisted</STRONG>: This is modeling where we're talking to a computer, most often to generate code, e.g. the .edmx file used by Visual Studio to generate C# data access code.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Model-Driven</STRONG>: Here we're also communicating from a human to a computer, but instead of doing it at development-time to generate code, the model is actually used at run-time to drive a run-time, e.g. a Workflow definition to drive the Workflow engine.</LI></OL>
<P>I've seen various samples around the interweb on model-driven aka "executable models" (some of which we've supplied on the <A href="http://msdn.com/oslo">Oslo DevCenter</A>), but <SPAN class=fn>Kirill Chilingarashvili</SPAN> has done <A href="http://blog.devarchive.net/2008/11/generating-code-using-ms-codename-t4.html">a nice little sample of combining Visual Studio's T4 codegen language with a custom DSL in MGrammar</A>. Enjoy!</P>
