<h1>Time for some anti-social networking</h1>
<P>OK, just after all my friends are on FaceBook, now I'm getting the requests to join Spock.com. I don't know what Spock.com is, but after the address-book thingie, MySpace, the high school alumni thingie, Friendster (?), the Google ork-something, the business thingie and most recently FaceBook, I'm all done. All I ever do on these sites is approve friends requests! Isn't there supposed to be some value to it other than that?</P>
<P>Oh, sure, I've had a few messages from people I haven't heard from in a while, but email works for that. In fact, email works for a helluva lot of the internet apps I see today. Plus, most of them just forward&nbsp;web form results to my email anyway!&nbsp;Why do I need a whole other thing when I've already got all my friends listed in my address book?</P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ff0000>I declare the social network backlash officially started!</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P>From now on, I'm going to be doing some <STRONG>anti-social networking </STRONG>around the ol' Casa de' Sells. If you want me, you know my email addresses,&nbsp;how to post comments on my blog&nbsp;and my phone number. That should be enough.</P>
<P>"*cough* When I was a boy, we didn't have these fancy social networks. *cough* *cough* We had email and we were happy to have it!"</P>
<P>"Yes, Grandpa. Shhhh...."</P>
