<h1>Programming WPF enters 2nd printing!</h1>
<P>Wahoo! <A href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-WPF-Chris-Sells/dp/0596510373/">You love us, you really love us!</A> : )</P>
<P>When a book goes to another printing, 100% of the time, there's a list of "errata" (aka "mistakes") that are fixed in the new printing. In this case, neither Ian nor I have any fixes to apply. So, it's official -- the book is perfect! : )</P>
<P>Thanks for reading.</P>
