<h1>The Next Generation</h1>
<P>When I was in high school, "game programmer" meant at best BASIC or at worst 6502 assembly language, but either way, lots of text manipulation. These days, high school-age programmers are going to camps and programming competitions having spent their time in drag-n-drop programming environments like <A href="http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</A>. They've been doing work flow for 7 versions already!</P>
<P>Yesterday, I was a judge and the keynote speaker at a high school game programming contest. After asking a bunch of the 25 teams questions about their games, I was asked to speak about careers in software to 100 high school computer geeks. My people!</P>
<DIV>I started by introducing my youngest son as the "slide monkey" to warm applause and them myself as a Microsoft employee to... silence. So, I said: "How many of you think that Microsoft is..." and then I put my face down to the podium microphone and said in a voice from God, "EVIL?". Half of them raised their hands, all of them laughed and I had them engaged for the next 20 minutes.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Instead of listing various careers and their duties, I had dug through literally 13 years worth of bad Internet humor (641 emails) that I'd saved over the years and <A HREF="/public/spout/SoftwareCareers.zip">used all the silly, stupid, funny pictures to illustrate the various careers</A>, like an x-ray of Homer's tiny brain (Architect), a picture of some hand puppets chasing a kitten (Legal), street signs that said "left turn" and "keep right" at the same time (User Assistance), etc. A couple pictures I had to clean up, like that one that said "Every time you masturbate, God kills a kitten," but even so, the pictures worked: they were listening to me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>While I had their attention, I told them two things. First, I told them that Microsoft was hiring. : )&nbsp; Second, and most importantly, I told them not to worry about the money, but to pick a job that's going to get them excited every day. Pick the job that's the most *fun*. And when that one isn't fun anymore, pick another one! I tried to put every ounce of sincerity I had into it, because I believe it. I love my work, I love who I work with and I think everyone should have that. I know it's silly, but if I could inspire just one person to reject some high paying job that's going to make them miserable in favor of a starvation-wages job that they'll love, then I'm happy.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And to illustrate the downside of picking the wrong job, I closed my talk showing a little boy balling his eyes out (although in his case, it was because of Santa's tombstone behind him : )</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What a good way to spend the day. Highly recommended.</DIV>
