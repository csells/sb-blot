<h1>More Oslo Reactions: What “Oslo” is and is not</h1>
Lars Corneliussen (not the wonderful Lars that did a cameo at <A href="http://mschnlnine.vo.llnwd.net/d1/pdc08/WMV-HQ/TL28.wmv">the Repository &amp; Schemas PDC talk</A> about 8 minutes in) did <A href="http://startbigthinksmall.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/post-pdc-again-what-is-oslo-m-mgrammar-quadrant-repository-textual-dsls-dsl-tools-uml-modeling-november-2008/">a nice overview of Oslo</A>. It's amazing to me how well the vision and details of the platform came through at the PDC. General-purpose modeling is a new thing for mainstream developers, but at least the developers that we've heard from so far seem to be open to the idea.
