<h1>George Carlin, Rest In Peace</h1>
<P>When I was a teenager, some kids were sneaking out to get drunk or have sex. I was sneaking into my parents' record collection to listen to <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin">George Carlin</A>. Unfortunately, unleashing my version of his brand of humor on my peers was one of the things that kept me from being invited for parties or sex, but I still dearly loved the man and was very sorry to hear that <A href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ina7M8zC1QQGSxe-e-PxBrf9kl0gD91G3D780">he passed away yesterday</A>.</P>
<P>Certain situations still trigger George Carlin responses whether I want them to or not; he is permanently lodged in my brain. And of all the things he's done, his <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLN6c_U0Acg">incomplete list of impolite words</A> is stuck in there furthest (*not* safe for work!).</P>
<P>I'll miss you, George. Give whatever all-powerful being you run into in the next life a piece of your mind about the state they've left us in here on Earth.</P>
