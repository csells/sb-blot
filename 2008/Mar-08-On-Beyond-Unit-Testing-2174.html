<h1>On Beyond Unit Testing</h1>
<P>Quetzal Bradley is a software development engineer (SDE) on my team with *tons* of experience in all manner of infrastructure stuff including the requirements of real-world software testing from the trenches at Microsoft.</P>
<P>Q gave a talk about what comes after unit testing to my team and I was blown away, so I sent him to tell Scott about it so that <A href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=121">you could hear it, too</A>.</P>
<P>Enjoy.</P>
