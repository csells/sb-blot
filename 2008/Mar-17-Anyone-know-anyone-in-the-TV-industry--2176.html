<h1>Anyone know anyone in the TV industry?</h1>
<P><A href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/default.aspx">Don</A> turned me onto <A href="http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Dead-Days-Gone-Bye/dp/1582403589">the Walking Dead series of "graphic novels"</A> (I'm too proud to call them "comic books!") and I loved them. I read volumes 1-4 in one day when I should've been doing other things.</P>
<P>Don thinks that they're good enough for a Lost-esque style 10pm cable TV show and I agree. The interplay of characters and watching them fall apart under the pressure is fascinating. The zombies are there, but it's mostly a background thing, like IRS agents when you forget to include the check (I wrote it! I swear I did!).</P>
<P>Anyone know anyone that needs the story for a new TV show? We'd watch and buy tons of advertisers' products!</P>
