<h1>Ted Neward Explores M</h1>
<P>When I was an external to Microsoft, I used to see new Microsoft technologies and have several reactions: wonder, awe, lust, hate, confusion, apathy. Really, Microsoft was a harsh mistress that caused all kinds of reactions.</P>
<P>I've been heads down for 3.5 years working on Oslo, so seeing other peoples' opinions from inside of Microsoft is very enlightening. <A href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/CommentView.aspx?guid=d2274e34-b9e5-4771-a877-505b58b8aa28">Ted Neward has an Oslo opinion</A> that I enjoyed reading, even if it wasn't all positive. Thanks, Ted.</P>
