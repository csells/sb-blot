<h1>Tired of writing unit tests yourself? Try Pex!</h1>
<P>From <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/cc950525.aspx">the Pex site</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Pex (Program EXploration) produces a traditional unit test suite with high code coverage. ... To do so, Pex performs a systematic white box program analysis. <STRONG>Pex learns the program behavior by monitoring execution traces, and uses a constraint solver to produce new test cases with different behavior.</STRONG> At Microsoft, this technique has proven highly effective in testing even an extremely well-tested component." [ed: emphasis mine]</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So, Pex will produce a parameterized set of unit tests for your classes and does all of this integrated with Visual Studio and the unit testing built into VS. I've seen <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/cc950525.aspx">the demo</A> and it blew me away. Nikolai Tillmann, a developer at MSR (Microsoft Research), has <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nikolait/archive/2008/10/21/sneak-preview-code-digger-the-new-pex-experience.aspx">a nice write-up that discusses his work</A>&nbsp;and when you're done with that, go <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/cc950525.aspx">download Pex</A>!</P>
