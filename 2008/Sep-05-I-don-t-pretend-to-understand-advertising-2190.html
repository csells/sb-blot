<h1>I don't pretend to understand advertising</h1>
<P>I've always liked <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac">the Mac vs. PC ads</A>.&nbsp;They're clever, they make me laugh and I like both actors (<A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384793/">Accepted</A> is very under rated, IMO). Of course, I actually prefer my PC running Windows to a Macintosh (I had a Mac IIcx back in the day), I prefer Vista to XP and I'm a Microsoft employee, so I don't have any trouble seeing the exaggeration, but there's always a kernel of truth, which is what makes them funny. The part that kinda annoys me is that Apple seems to be claiming they have no such problems, which is, of course, not true.</P>
<P>The Mac vs. PC ads I understand: they're meant to put down the PC by having the PC guy look like an idiot, leaving the Mac guy to seem non-threatening and therefore better by comparison.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I can't say I understand <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afR5J7eskno">the latest Windows ad with Jerry and Bill</A>. I did enjoy it, however. Not only did Bill seem much friendlier and more approachable than I've ever seen him, but the image of someone in the shower with their shoes and socks on made me laugh, as did the image of Bill wiggling his butt in a <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Throat">Deep Throat</A> sorta way.</P>
<P>And the commercials are having an effect: they're being talked about and folks are interested in the next one. How often do you hear about folks looking forward to a commercial? That in and of itself is an achievement.</P>
