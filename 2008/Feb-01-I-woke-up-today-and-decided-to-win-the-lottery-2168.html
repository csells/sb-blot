<h1>I woke up today and decided to win the lottery</h1>
<P>And so I did the only thing I could to do increase my odds -- I actually <EM>played </EM>the lottery. (I blame my inability to apply this strategy for my lottery losings in the past.)</P>
<P>I did a little research and then went to two local Plaid Pantries to purchase the Oregon Lottery "Trio."</P>
<P>At the first Plaid Pantry, an thin, stringy haired older lady behind the counter blinked in surprise when she saw me and then laughed to herself.</P>
<P>"I just saw your geek pin. It's so subtle... geek..." she said. "I wish I would've paid more attention to geeks when I was growing up. I only paid attention to the rockers."</P>
<P>"Well, that's pretty common," I said.</P>
<P>"But they're dumb and self-centered!"</P>
<P>"Yeah, but they get all the girls..."</P>
<P>"Well, I'm not a girl anymore and I prefer nerds. They're more stimulating!"</P>
<P>"Well," I said. "On behalf of the geek community, thank you."</P>
<P>She smiled, handed me my tickets and I left proud of my geek heritage.</P>
<P>At the second Plaid Pantry, a crowd had formed at the front desk. I got to the front of the line and a little old lady with a plastic tiara was cutting into a homemade chocolate fudge cake. The lady behind the counter said, "It's her birthday! And we love her!"</P>
<P>"Your birthday!" I said.</P>
<P>The birthday girl said, "Yep, don't you see my 65-year-old birthday crown?"</P>
<P>"Lovely," I said. "Happy birthday!"</P>
<P>The lady behind the counter said, "Well, no one was going to make a cake, so I did. That oughta be against the law."</P>
<P>I agreed and placed my Trio order. On the way out, I was happy to have been even a short part of that woman's birthday at the local convenience store where she was loved.</P>
<P>I decided to walk across the street to the locally owned coffee shop, tucked away off the main streets, fighting for survival against the Starbucks juggernaut. I walked in, said good morning to Ju, the owner and proprietor, who immediate started making my standard order. I haven't been there for months, but he still remembered what I wanted.</P>
<P>It's already been a good day. Think how much better it'll be after they announce my winning numbers? : )</P>
