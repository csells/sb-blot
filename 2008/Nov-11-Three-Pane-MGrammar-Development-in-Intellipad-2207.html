<h1>Three-Pane MGrammar Development in Intellipad</h1>
<P>Roger Alsing has posted a discussion of <A href="http://rogeralsing.com/2008/11/10/m-grammar-vs-gold-parser/">how Intellipad's support for MGrammar development makes writing DSLs easier</A> but showing you what parsers and how as you update the input file and the grammar file itself.</P>
<P>Personally, I'm a huge fan of seeing something work as I type. Think of it as&nbsp;"holistic intellsense."&nbsp;The SQL generation in Intellipad works the exact same way. I find it a huge help.</P>
