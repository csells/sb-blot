<h1>Oslo: Using Mg to Define a To-Do Language</h1>
<P>Justin Bailey has built <A href="http://blog.codeslower.com/2008/11/Exploring-Oslo-Using-Mg-to-Define-a-To-Do-Language">a little language in MGrammer to create tasks</A> and even better, he's provided a very tutorial on how he did it. Following along with him would make a great way to learn the basics of Mg. Plus, I love his conclusions:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><EM>"Mg is clearly a powerful technology for defining languages. The above is a trivial use, but already we have bypassed most simple file parsing techniques. Quoted strings and balanced parentheses are the bane of non-parsing techniques and it appears that Mg will be placing those abilities within reach of most .NET developers."</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Good work, Justin!</P>
