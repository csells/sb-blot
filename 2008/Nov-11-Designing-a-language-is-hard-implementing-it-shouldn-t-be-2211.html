<h1>Designing a language is hard; implementing it shouldn't be</h1>
<P>Frans Bouma has an interesting point: <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2008/11/05/designing-a-language-is-hard-and-m-won-t-change-that.aspx">Designing a language is hard, and M won't change that</A>. And he's right.</P>
<P>For many domains, a DSL can make expressing what's important easier so that the developers using the DSLs can communicate between themselves and to a computer with fewer lines of code, making it easier to read, check and maintain. Many (arguably most) domains live without a DSL, instead encoding design decisions into general purpose languages, adding <A href="http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/4/1/ending-legacy-code-in-our-lifetime">unnecessary ceremony to the essence</A> of what's being decided, thereby obscuring it.</P>
<P>Does M making designing a language easier? No. It's still hard to design the syntax of a language. Does the M family of languages and the associated tools make it possible for more developers to add DSLs to their domains, letting them concentrate on the essence their language and reducing the <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090305/">Weird Science</A>-like ceremony to bring it to life? We hope so. <A href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/oslo/threads/">You'll have to let us know.</A></P>
