#Chapter 1: Back Story
Lord Christus von Lofton III took a deep breath and opened the door to The Busted Rake, the seediest tavern in town, reputed to be filled with idle farmers, thieves, ruffians and worse by far, the adventurer. At 25, he'd never been here. He'd never even been to this part of town. As the fifth heir to the Barony of Rasselton, he was superfluous as at home, so never felt the need to join his brothers in their carousing, no matter how much shit they give him about his "pious" ways.

Well, he was pious. As a warrior of the cloth, he was a proud Lieutenant in in the local Order of Tyr. In spite of his age and his training, the title was not earned, but rather bestowed on his 13th birthday, the day he joined the order. He'd walked a different path than his brothers, who'd taken the schooling to work in the business that gave their family their wealth and power in this region. Theirs was a land of peace, so while they did have a local constabulary, they had no need for an army beyond the occasional mercenaries his father hired for "trade route expansion", as he called it.

And that was why his military title was honorary: he had never been bloodied in a real battle. He'd not yet "proved his metal" as his father would say. "If you're going to training as a soldier," Baron Lofton often said, "then you might as well make yourself useful." However, turning the surrounding villages and communities into serfdom's to expand his father's holdings never seemed worthy of his order.

And his uncle, the High Priest of Tyr, agreed. "There's real evil in the world, my boy," his uncle told him the day he'd moved into the priest's cell that would become his home. "That's why you're here. Tyr has a purpose for you beyond acquiring land and collecting coin."

And so, as he entered dirty tavern, he heard the voice of his uncle, promising the purpose he sought, but he also heard the sneer of his father, deriding him for choosing a life away from the family business.

#Chapter 2: The Tavern
Christus strode into the tavern with more confidence they he felt. "Take my pack, boy," he said, dumping 50 pounds worth of unused equipment into the arms of a surprised busboy that had had the bad luck to be standing by the door. "And don't you dare get it dirty!" 

"Yes sir," the boy said, struggling to keep the pack off the dirt floor at least until Christus turned his back, then dragging it behind the bar for safe keeping.

As Christus surveyed the bar's interior, the second thing he noticed was how small it was for how many people it held. There was a bartender behind a bar that stretched the length of the room and seemed to serve all manner of cheap ales and spirts as well of bowls of stew cooking in the fireplace in the corner. There was a waitress alternating between serving and fighting off the advances of the patrons, made up of what looked to match exactly the kinds of commoners for which it had built it's reputation, clothed in what to Christus appear to be colorless rags and sacks held together with rope and bits of leather. The noise that they made was only drowned out by the noise of some kind of, he supposed, "music" coming from a man and his lute, singing and playing with the only apparent goal of being heard of the rest of the din.

However, the press of bodies and cacophony couldn't compare to the first thing he'd noticed: the smell. It hit him in the face the moment he'd moved into the room, a combination of animal droppings, wet animal fur, burn animal flesh and he was sure he smelled the same kinds animal innards he'd encountered before in the barony's kitchens, before they'd be served to guests as delicacies. This was combined with the rank of stale ale, spoiled wine, wet smoke and human sweat. He could feel himself getting dirty just starting in the place. The onslaught stopped him in is tracks and nearly backed him out the door, but Christus held his ground until he found a bit of empty space in the back to sit, but only after he'd wiped the chair with the handkerchief from his pouch. *Now what?* he thought now that he was away from the throng. *At home, I'd simply order what I wanted and servants would bring it. I wonder how to find the adventure he sought without that?*

As he pondered, the waitress stopped by his table. "Well, well, what brings you here, my liege?" she said, giving him a sarcastic courtesy that Christus missed completely.

"I seek adventure," Christus said.

"Ha. I can see that, although dressed as you are, you're not likely to appreciate the kind of adventure that comes through in here," she said.

Christus looking down at himself self-consciously. He'd spent hours choosing this outfit, careful to balance the gleam of his new chainmail and the crest on his shield with his deep sapphire of his velvet cape that he felt brought out the blue of his eyes. He thought it was understated and utilitarian while still showing off his own personal style. He wondered now if he should've worn the sash, but his man Jeffrey had talked him out of it.

The waitress turned her laugh into a cough as he looked back up at her, genuinely puzzled. "Well, while you wait for your 'adventure', can I get you something? Stew? Ale?"

Christus couldn't help but wrinkle his nose at the thought of food in this place, so decided to order something safe, "Wine. Your best."

"You shall have it, my lord, although I'm not sure your definition of 'best' match's Tony's over there," she said, nodding to the bartender. "He runs the place with a strictly 'cheaper is better' philosophy."

As she left, Christus noticed a commotion by the door. A dwarf dressed in finery, at least compared to the other patrons, was saying something as he strode into the middle of the room, gesturing for attention. He was followed by two large human men, both armed with swords and dressed in leather armor.

The room quieted a little and the dwarf spoke up again, this time with Christus able to hear him. "I am Barnable, a local merchant. I'm new in town and interested in expanding my trade into this area. I need the help of some capable adventurers to help me. If you're interested in taking a little risk for a few gold, please let me buy you a drink." He gestured to a table that his guards had cleared in the corner opposite of Christus's own, heading to it as he did so.

*Am I to turn away from one merchant to help another?* Christus thought as he got up. Two steps towards the dwarf and his men, Christus was stopped by the waitress. "Don't forget your wine, honey," she said, handing him a rough cup. Christus took it without a thank you, unwilling to let her stop him once he'd started to build up momentum. As he approached the dwarf's table, he took a drink and nearly choked as he swallowed what was clearly not wine as far as his tastebuds were concerned. He turned to look back at the waitress, anger on his face, but she only laughed. "That'll be two coppers," she said. "That's our finest dessert wine." Christus started to protest, but was interrupted by the dwarf behind him.

"You seem a fine specimen," Barnable said. "You'll do nicely."

"Do for what?" Christus said, turning back around, the burn on his tongue forgotten. "What do you need? I'll not terrorize simple farmers to expand your lands."

"Aw. I thought I recognized your crest. You're one of the von Lofton boys, aren't you? And to answer your question, I do not conduct business the way your family does. I'm opening up a new shop here and need supplies from my warehouse in Essex. The only terrorizing you'll see will be my men here terrorizing the bandits that may try to stop the shipment. You certainly look you'd be useful for this kind of work, but have you got the training that goes along with that fancy equipment?" As soon as he said that, he slapped the table. With that signal, one of his men drew his sword and made a slash at Christus. The man was fast, but Christus was faster, bringing his warhammer around by pure reflex, crashing towards the man's head. The sharp "thud" was not the sound of Christus killing the guard, however, but of the warhammer slamming into the other guard's shield, sending him sprawling.

"Whoa! Whoa!" Barnable said, laughing but not having moved during the shuffle. "That'll do, son. You clearly have the stuff. Welcome to my team. And if I'm not mistaken, we've got another candidate right here." Barnable gestured to Christus's right, directing his gaze as he lowered his warhammer, attempting to calm himself after the sudden, unexpected attack. *I nearly killed that man,* he thought. *Tyr bless me, but I'd have killed them both if Barnable hadn't stopped me.*

Having turned to look at the other potential companion, he was confused to see no one standing there.

"Down here," he heard. The voice was coming from a tiny man, draped in a small cape, wearing round, dark glasses, even though the tavern was dimly lit and hazey.

"You? You're so small. What can you do to that would be any use at all?" Christus said.

Barnable said, "I have the same question, little gnome, but I suspect I know the answer. Can I have a demonstration?"

The gnome jumped up onto a chair and then the table, causing both Barnable and Christus to lean back. "I'm not small, I'm compact. You get more help from me pound for pound then you'll get from this high born, I can tell you. My name is Kruft, not that you asked, and I have ways to make myself... useful."

"Pfft," Christus said. "You're just a gnome."

Kruft made a small gesture involving three fingers on both hands. "You've got red on you," Kruft said, smirking and pointing at Christus's chainmail.

Looking down, Christus saw that his armor had a big red splotch on it, but not like blood, more like a swipe of a paint brush across his chest.

"Hey!" Christus said, reaching for his hankerchief. "I just had this polished! You better not have ruined my armor, gnome."

"Relax. It'll work itself out once you've shown some respect," Kruft said, "or in an hour or so, whichever comes first."

"It better!" Christus said, wiping his hankerchief over the red spot to no avail. 

"Aha! As I suspected. Well then, both of you are hired! You'll each get one gold now and ten gold upon your return with my shipment," Barnable said, putting one gold piece into each Christus's and Kruft's hands. Kruft tucked his away into the pouch on his belt, but Christus looked at his a second. He was about to toss it onto the table in front of him, but turned towards the waitress and the rest of the crowd that was watching this spectacle.

Tossing the coin towards the waitress, Christus said, "I believe tipping is customary?" She caught he as he turned away, heading towards the door, grabbing his pack from behind the bar and saying to no one in particular, "Well, let's go then," opened the door and strode out into the street. Kruft said, "Spoiled nobles," but hurried after, as did both of the guards with a gesture from the their boss.

"You come on back, deary!" the waitress said, waving towards the door as it closed behind the adventurers.

#Chapter 3: An Encounter in the Woods
Christus kept right on walking down the road and out of the town towards Essex, a nearby town about two days away on foot. The guards are grabbed their own packs from a wagon near the tavern in which they'd apparently ridden into town with their master. Kruft already had his pack on, small as it was under his cloak. They walked in silence, neither guard bothering to introduce themselves or attempt to lead, content to let Christus set the pace. During his training, Christus had worked his muscles with wooden weapons and sparring partners, so while he was strong, he was not used to walking any great distances. By the time they'd reached the edge of the town, he'd slowed up considerably, his endurance flagging with his resolve. Eventually, the guards outpaced him as did the gnome, skipping past and looking back, grinning. *You try this with 100 pounds of equipment,* he thought to himself, readjusting his pack and warhammer for the upteenth time.

As the sun started to set, the guards slowed down and angled off of the road, into the woods for 100 yards or so. "We'll set camp here for the night, if it's all the same to you, your magesty," they said, with sarcasm that even Christus didn't miss. He frowned and said "Fine," secretly happy for the rest.

Kruft gathered some wood and started a fire while the guards rolled out light blankets on the ground. Christus rumaged around his pack, pulling out a much thicker blanket. And a pillow. He looked around for the least dirty place to make camp but finding no good choices, finally settled on a patch of grass a good distance from the rest of the party. The guards offered him roasted rodent of some kind, which Christus refused in favor of some cured ham, apples and a piece of pie wrapped in a cloth from his mother.

"You be careful, son," she'd said during their goodbyes. "I don't think this is a good idea! You'll be outside, you know. They'll be animals. And commoners! It's just not right. I worry for you."

"The boy will be fine, Edna," his father had said. "It's time he did something useful. If he's not going to learn the business, at least he can learn to fight. There are lands to acquire."

His uncle pulled him aside and said gently, "Go and find your place in the world, Chris. Things are peaceful here, but there is evil that needs tending to. Make Tyr as proud of you as I already am."

It was Kruft that brought him back from his memories as Christus finished his pie. "Hey. You probably want to get a little closer to the fire, your lordship. There are nasty things in the woods after dark. Especially as the evening fog rolls in."

The fog wasn't unusual this time of year, but it was one thing to see it from a parapit of your anchestoral home and another to be camping in it as it thickened around you.

"I'll be fine," Christus said, putting his head back on his pillow and trying to find a way to get comfortable on the hard, rocky ground.

"OK," said Kruft. "I guess our holy warrior is off the list for first watch. Any takers?"

Before anyone had a chance to answer, there was a sound from the woods. Sitting up, Christus and the others looked towards the source, coming from deeper in the woods. Out of the canopy and into the light from the campfire came a bat. And then another. And then a third, all headed towards the light of the fire. The four party members got to their feet, with Christus the last to rise. *What harm could a few bats do?* he thought. *They're just dirty sky rats anyway...*

As they approached, this bats seemed larger than normal. Also, they weren't headed over the party or towards the party, but dove towards the three tallest of the party, swooping in to bite at each of them. Christus dodged but one of the guards wasn't so lucky, yelling as one took a piece out of him, batting at it uselessly with his sword as it flew by. In fact, both of the guards seemed useless, neither landing a hit at these bats as they swooped back in for another bite, this time getting the other guard.

Christus crushed one with his warhammer just as Kruft produced a stream of words and gestures, pointed his hands at one of the bats and a line of fire sprang forth, lighting the bat on fire as it shrieked and fell to the ground. Christus was surprised and despite himself, impressed. He'd heard of such things before but never seen it in person. *Clearly there is more to this gnome than I thought.*

As the second bat fell, Kruft turned his fire to the third bat. Christus was able to add the might of his warhammer when three wolves came bursting through the woods, two on the guards and one on Christus. The guards appeared to have greater luck with the larger targets, but even so, one was taken down by a wolf just as Christus landing a giant blow on the alpha of the pack. The wolf yelped and was clearly badly injured, but kept on coming, clawing across Christus's arm and drawing a lot of blood. By this time, one of the guards was down and Kruft had turned his fire towards it, cutting through it's fur into his it's flesh. The wolf was again badly hurt, but advanced again, this time on Kruft. By this time, both of the guards were down, but they'd taken one wolf with them. One wolf advanced on Christus as the third closed on Kruft, overwhelming him and apparently making it impossible for him to throw his fire.

At this point, across the clearly, a humanoid figure erupted out of the woods, tall and green in the flickering firelight, armored and armed with an enormous axe.

"Hey. You no hurt puppy!" he said, continuing at a run towards the battle. "Puppy! Sit! Stay!"

"These aren't puppies!" Christus said, bringing his hammer down on the wolf about to take a bite out of Kruft, crushing it's skull. "And they aren't going to follow your commands!" Kruft said, throwing fire onto one of the wolves attacking Christus, taking care of the last of them.

"What are you?" Christus asked of the warrior that reminded him of nothing more than an orc, although one that talked like a human. Before the orc could answer, Christus noticed that the fog had suddenly become a lot thicker, now making it hard to see the edge of the clearing. He also noticed that the bodies of the guards were moving towards the fog, at first under what seemed like their own power but then it was clear that some kind of plants were pulling them. Some kind of plant person stood between Christus and a few more plant people, dragging the guards into the fog, which continued to roll in, now as thick as a wall.

"I Rane Morgutz", the orc-ish creature said proudly, as if he'd made the name up on the spot. "I from Clan of the Wolf. White Wolf! Clan of the White Wolf!" At this point, Rane brought his axe down in front of Christus, cleaving the plant person it half as it leaped to attack. "Stick people bad. Rane not like stick people. Stick people eat people people."

With that bit of information, Christus leaped into the fog after the fallen guards, not knowing if they were alive or dead. The world got immediately white and wet and silent. He could no longer see the forest, hear his companions or follow the trail of the fallen guards. He stopped short and stepped back, trying to retrace his footsteps, but not stepping out of the fog. He called for Kruft and Rane and to his relief, after a minute he heard them call back, but faintly as if at a great distance. And then he saw and heard nothing at all.

#Chapter 4: Bavonia
Christus awoke in his bed w/o opening his eyes, groaning at the workout from the day before. This was a common occurance in his training and without thinking about it, he reached out to the mightly Tyr to bless him as his uncle had taught him. He felt the warmth flow from his core, his soul, to spread throughout his whole body, taking much of the pain away, loosening his muscles and restoring his energy. The effect wasn't total, however, which surprised Christus. As an adept, he'd been only able to heal himself a little, but as he'd grown in age and experience, he'd found this ability to be completely restorative. This morning, however, he still had a pain in his back, as if it was poking him through his armor. *Armor? Did I fall asleep in my armor?*

At that, the memory came flooding back -- the tavern, the waitress who hadn't flinched at his anger, the mission to Essex, the bats, the wolves and the plant people. Christus bolted upright, his hands finding his warhammer as he leaped to his feet, taking in his surroundings.

-the party decided to visit the local priest looking for advice and healing potions

-found the priest distraught, begging the party to help his son, who was having "fits" and was in the basement. Christus said that he would be able to lay on hands to cure any mental illness. "Will we need to restrain him, father?" "Only if he's loose..." the father said? *Loose?* Rane, can you hold the boy down while I lay on hands?

The party descended through a trap door that had to be unlocked by the priest. Down the stairs to a dimly lit basement, clearly not fit for a person to live in. In the center, his son tied to a post, clearly not having fits at all but rather afflicted with vampirism. "Father, I can't cure him. We need to put him down." The father only sat and cried with his head in his hands. Rane, can you separate his head from his shoulders in one clean stroke to put this boy out of his misery as quickly as possible? "Rane lay on axe!"

The boy took the chop to the neck and went into a rage and his head did not separate from his neck. Instead, the cut made into the boy's neck opened and then partially closed right before the boy broke free from his bonds. A fight ensured that left the boy dead and the party alive, although just barely. They separated the head from the boy's body, burning the head and bringing the wrapped body up the stairs to the father. He was too distraught to do anything, neither providing advice or potions. Christus was able to heal them partially but they were still injured by the time they showed up at the mansion to meet the Burgermeister.
