<h1>Head of Google interviewing says “results matter, riddles don’t”</h1>
<p><a href="/public/post-images/12735-254.png"><img title="google" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="google" src="/public/post-images/12735-255.png" width="240" align="right" height="85" /></a>Google, like Microsoft, is famous for asking brain-teaser style questions during their interviews. However, in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html">a June, 2013 interview with the New York Times</a>, Laszlo Bock, the Sr. VP of HR for Google, said that</p>  <p>“[B]ainteasers are a complete waste of time. How many golf balls can you fit into an airplane? How many gas stations in Manhattan? A complete waste of time. They don’t predict anything. They serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart.”</p>  <p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google-part-2.html">another interview</a>, Bock said that when putting together a resume, focus on what you did in relation to the expectations:</p>  <p>“The key is to frame your strengths as: ‘I accomplished X, relative to Y, by doing Z.’ Most people would write a résumé like this: ‘Wrote editorials for The New York Times.’ Better would be to say: ‘Had 50 op-eds published compared to average of 6 by most op-ed [writers] as a result of providing deep insight into the following area for three years.’ Most people don’t put the right content on their résumés.”</p>  <p>Amen!</p>
